3934:Mountains
3935:Mountain ranges on the Slavyan natural lands can be a good source of resources. There are caves and quarries hidden amongst the rocks, but beware of bears or bandits in the lairs. Although trolls are unlikely to dwell here, their offspring, the rockers are more common.
3936:Hills
3937:Although not as steep as mountains, hills can provide hideouts for many dangerous creatures of Thea, but you can also discover caves and quarries ripe for exploring.
3938:Swamps
3939:Swamps have always attracted dark creatures and mischievous demons, as well as swampers, so one should always remain on guard when trying to brave a swamp.
3940:Plains
3941:Plains stretch throughout the land and are one of the most common land types. Beware of field demons who favour this terrain.
3942:Dryland
3943:Dryland is often the remnant of the light burning away all that stood in its way. It is typically a barren terrain, deserts filled with nothing but sand, although abandoned ruins or cemeteries are not uncommon. Beware of dirt storms or quicksand.
3944:Forest
3945:Forests have been slowly regaining their strength after the darkness many ages ago. They can be the lifesaving source of wood, but beware of forest guardians who may not take kindly to your presence.
3946:Darkness Mountains
3947:Mountain ranges in the lands of darkness are often places of safe haven from the black mist that plagues the lowlands, or so many hope. That hope often proves futile when one is faced with the mroki, who have an affinity for mountain tops.
3948:Darkness Hills
3949:In the lands swept up by gusts of the black mist, a remnant of darker times, hillsides can quickly become treacherous. You may find old quarries and hidden caves here, but beware of what may lurk within.
3950:Darkness Swamps
3951:Swamps of Darkness - ordinary swamps are considered gloomy, odd places filled with dangers lurking in the mist. But when you find yourself on the swamps of darkness, that seems like a kind description. 
3952:Darkness Plains
3953:Plains of Darkness are filled with the bones of creatures who fell to the dread of the black mist. For reasons unknown the dark force lingers here and continues to diminish any chance of these plains blooming again.
3954:Darkness Dryland
3955:In the lands ravaged by darkness, dryland remain as a reminder of its destructive force. No life can truly thrive here, at least not one that isn't filled with the dangerous force. It is perhaps the reason for the banished shadow elves and their new kin, the mroki to favour such terrain and call it theirs.
3956:Darkness Forest
3957:Forests of Darkness are unusual places. The trees remain twisted with the taint, turning them into dark wood, or simply hollow husks. More likely than green oaks are great, towering fungal growths, glowing in unhealthy colours in the night. This is likely why many goblin tribes decided to settle here. 
3958:Ice Mountains
3959:The icy peaks of the moutain ranges on these lands are as treacherous as they are lonely. Here the dziad mroz and his grandauthers the sniezynki hold dominion and they do not like visitors.
3960:Ice Hills
3961:Icy hillsides may look pretty with the calm, blanket of snow wrapped around every curve. But beware of the old ruins, abandoned caves where only the heartless creatures of the ice, or long forgotten spirits of old dwell.
3962:Ice Swamps
3963:Ice swamps are an odd phenomenon. Despite the ever-low temperature, the earth here remains hot and thus creates these pockets of quicksand and mud hidden beneath the ice. Beware, ice trolls are just as likely to dwell here as their kinder cousins from the mud.
3964:Ice Plains
3965:In these quiet, lonesome lands, the ice plains can stretch for miles. Occasionally, one can encounter ruins of old cities, frozen in time and often guarded by the lost spirits of their once inhabitants.
3966:Ice Drylands
3967:Icy drylands, like the ice plains, can stretch to the horizon. Although this land is devoid of life, you may still find stray beasts here and they will surely be looking for their next meal, any meal.
3968:Ice Forest
3969:The frozen forests of the icy land are beautiful in their own right. Ice demons, ruled by the dziad mroz, will sometimes choose the forests as their frozen home. One should be very careful to visit such dwellings, as creatures of the ice do not like the warm blooded much.
3970:Volcanic Mountains
3971:Volcanic Mountains stick out of the land like protruding black claws of a fire beast. Ash clouds, lava pits and eruptions are only the tip of the fire mount. Lava trolls favour the mountains as their domain, and they are amongst the most aggressive of their kind.
3972:Volcanic Hills
3973:Vulcanic hillsides are ash-covered mounds filled with treacherous lava pits and roming bands of orc bandits.
3974:Volcanic Swamps
3975:Volcanic Swamps are steaming hot-spots. Orc clans use them as scorching bathhouses, although it is not a recommended holiday spot for any other folk.
3976:Volcanic Plains
3977:Filled with scorched grass and ash covered fields, it is not easy to be a farmer on the volcanic lands, this is probably why most orc clans live from raiding.
3978:Volcanic Dryland
3979:Drylands are the staple terrain of the volcanic lands. Cracked earth, steaming hot-spots and lava pits. Occasionally, one can find the scorched ruins of old cities, or burial grounds for warriors fallen in some great battle.
3980:Volcanic Forest
3981:The eleves would not call these burned out husks trees nor the ash-covered groupings of the husks as forests, but this is what the volcanic land has to offer. If any live trees do survive and thrive on this harsh soil, they are to be admired.
3982:Ancient Forest Mountains
3983:The green mountain tops on the ancient forest lands are often referred to as sleeping giants by the elder kin. But is this is a metaphor to describe their grandeur and shape, or a factual description?
3984:Ancient Forest Hills
3985:Evergreen mounds filled with exotic plants and hidden alcoves. Damage done by the darkness in the past and the scorching light since the Shattering diminished the plenitude, but these hills remain a sight of beauty.
3986:Ancient Forest Swamps
3987:The swamps on this ancient land are old and mysterious. Many creatures unwanted in the main forest seek refuge here, so travellers should remain wary.
3988:Ancient Forest Plains
3989:The plains of the ancient forest lands area a mesmerising display of exotic plant life and exuberant colours. The bed of flowers creates a sweet smell that can make you forget how dangerous the world is.
3990:Ancient Forest Drylands
3991:In the old days there would be no dryland where the elder races dwell. But the devastation of the days of darkness and now the scorching infestation of the light have left their ugly mark.
3992:Ancient Forest Woodland
3993:The woodland is of course the heart and soul of the ancient forest. Treelines soaring sky-high dwarf anyone who walks amongst them. These old woodlands are home not only to the elven folk, but also to the most revered forest demons who remain vigilant in protecting this last true haven of nature.
3994:Metallic Mountains
3995:Metallic Mountains are the new surface home of the dwarves, who now call themselves the Earthbound, to remember that one day they must return to their true abode. These mountains are steep and ravelled with tunnels and caves. Rock trolls and dragons also favour them as their lair.
3996:Metallic Hills
3997:Metallic lands came to being after the Shattering threw out the home of the dwarves onto the surface. As such, the hills here are an odd amalgamation of stone and metal. You can come across ruins of the dwarven cities that fell long ago, or the sacred burial grounds spit out onto the surface.
3998:Metallic Swamps
3999:Swamps and quicksand are ever a dangerous place for wanderers, but in the lands of metal and stone they can be an interesting sight, with metallic water surfaces and stone shrubbery.
4000:Metallic Plains
4001:In the harsh lands of metal and stone, the plains are grey and solemn as if grass itself decided to toughen up and show a true dwarven spirit.
4002:Metallic Drylands
4003:While drylands and steppes in other lands are often seen as wastelands, here they are valued for their occasional source of good stone.
4004:Metallic Forest
4005:Dwarves are not fond of woodlands and their homeland seems to share this sentiment. Trees here are scarce, and more often than not their bark becomes infested with a metallic tinge, or a stone sickness that prevents growth.

4022:Lightbringers
4023:A house was destroyed in a shattering.
4024:The family that lived there was taken by the light and they act really strangely now. These light attacks are becoming more frequent int he land, you must keep your eyes open for an opportunity to investigate this.
4025:The gods visited your dreams.
4026:Whether willingly or by force, you were marked as chosen and told you will one day need to face a great task for the gods.
4027:Bandits have stolen your goods.
4028:You managed to track the bandits to their lair, you can take revenge and reclaim your goods.
4029:The bastards have escaped with your stuff, but maybe you will catch up to them with some luck.
4030:A hahalek demon was holding your goods.
4031:The demon spoke of light hurting it and so forcing even a house demon to work for the bandits. The lightbringers are clearly disturbing the balance in the land.
4032:You killed the pesky demon, but it is odd why a house demon would work for bandits. Demons seem to be acting strange these days.
4033:You found an eerily empty swamp with only one odd-looking toad left.
4034:The toad asked to be taken to a witch's hut nearby. It gave you directions so you should see the hut if you look for it.
4035:You killed the weird toad.
4036:You left the swamp.
4037:You found the witch's hut and it seems to be a baba yaga. She asked for the toad.
4038:The toad looked like a cmuch demon, but was actually a cursed vodnik. The 'prince' was grateful for his release. He told you of demons being burned by the light that came from the ground. Some died, some became changed. This light is clearly poisoning the land.
4039:You failed to undo the cmuch's curse, but the yaga, she mentioned something about the swamp's demons disappearing after a shattering and a light appearing. Likely another case of the lightbringers meddling.
4040:You attacked the baba yaga and so you did not get much information from her or the cmuch. Keep an eye out for more trails of the lightbringers activities
4041:You left the toad with the yaga, she mentioned something about the swamp's demons disappearing after a shattering and a light appearing. Likely another case of the lightbringers meddling.
4042:You attacked the vodnik and so you did not get much information from him or the yaga. Keep an eye out for more trails of the lightbringers activities.
4043:You were assaulted by light-wisps.
4044:Eventually the wisps flicker away towards the sun and disappear.You see burnt carcasses of bugs and small critters around you, but you also spot a small pack of oddly paired beings moving away in unison, as if trying to follow the wisps. This light-scourge needs to be stopped. keep a lookout for a way.
4045:You are ambushed by the scoundrels that took your goods earlier.
4046:You defeated the bandits and reclaimed your goods. The scoundrels spoke of the earth shattering their homes and light taking their folk driving them to banditry. This light-scourge needs to be stopped. keep a lookout for a way.
4047:They defeat you but let you go. The scoundrels spoke of the earth shattering their homes and light taking their folk driving them to banditry. This light-scourge needs to be stopped. keep a lookout for a way.
4048:You came across an odd man, calling himself an Alchemist.
4049:You kill the man and loot his strange table. Among other things, you find a map with a place distinctly marked: 'Stupid bandits unable to grasp the importance of their cave - need to get in here before all shatters!'
4050:You tried but failed to kill the Alchemist, but he let you live and proved to be an agent of the divine will like you. He told you of a red cave that may hold the secret to the lightbringer scourge. But in order to get into the cave, you need to deal with the Red Ridge Bandits, who set up camp near the cave's entrance. The bandit lair should appear on your map.
4051:The Alchemist proved to be an agent of the divine will also, and he told you of a red cave that may hold the secret to the lightbringer scourge. But in order to get into the cave, you need to deal with the Red Ridge Bandits, who set up camp near the cave's entrance. The bandit lair should appear on your map.
4052:You found the lair of the Red Ridge Bandits.
4053:You destroyed the bandits and thus the entrance to the Red Cave stands open for you. The Alchemist agreed to meet you inside when you are ready.
4054:You tried to kill the bandits but they defeated you and so there is little chance of getting into the cave that way. The Alchemist recommended going to a scavenger camp nearby to seek their aid in defeating the bandits.
4055:The bandits are willing to let you into the Red Cave, but only if you deal with some scavengers that are bothering them, or a pesky demon living in an old mine. Both locations should appear on your map now.
4056:The bandits are willing to let you into the Red Cave, but only if you deal with some scavengers that are bothering them, or a baba yaga living in a hut nearby. Both locations should appear on your map now.
4057:You sneak into the bandit camp and manage to rescue the scavenger child, along with a few others.They are unusually reluctant to be rescued, so they make a real ruckus and you are forced to run fast before the bandits catch you. There's little chance of them being friendly now, but you can go back to the scavengers and report your success.
4058:The bandits sold you the scavenger child. Now you can go back to the scavengers and report your success.
4059:The Red Ridge bandits allowed you access to the Red Cave as agreed. The Alchemist will meet you at the cave when you're ready.
4060:After making the deal with the scavengers, you destroyed the bandits. To get to the Red Cave return to the scavengers and give them their child back.
4061:You arrived at the scavenger settlement that is at odds with the Red Ridge bandits.
4062:You agreed to pretend you killed the scavengers, to either poison the bandits or steal back the scavenger child. Go back to the Red Ridge bandit camp and lie to them.
4063:You failed to convince the scavengers to help you out, so they chase you away. You can try killing them when you're better prepared.
4064:You failed to kill the scavengers, so they chase you away. You can try killing them when you're better prepared.
4065:You killed the scavengers, time to report back to the bandits so you may gain access to the Red Cave.
4066:You convinced the scavengers to leave, time to report back to the bandits so you may gain access to the Red Cave.
4067:The scavengers were not eager to help you in any way, killing the bandits seems like the only way to get into the Red Cave now.
4068:The scavengers are happy with your results and so they help you get into the Red Cave. The Alchemist will likely await you at the entrance when you're ready.
4069:You see the remains of a scavenger settlement, it is destroyed. perhaps the bandits decided to deal with them after all.
4070:You found the witch hut the bandits wanted destroyed.
4071:Your actions failed. The house shifts and shakes and you feel it becoming very hostile towards you. You can try to attack later, or find another path.
4072:You succeeded to deal with the witch so you can go back to the bandits and report your success.
4073:The witch convinced you not to kill her, instead she will stay low for a time, so you can try and lie to the bandits and say you did kill her.
4074:But you decided to leave for now.
4075:The witch was happy to learn of your success and wished you well. She and her hut have moved away from this place.
4076:You found the demon occupied mine the bandits wanted cleared.
4077:But you decided to leave for now.
4078:The demons were happy to learn of your success and wished you well.
4079:You made a deal with the demon to go back to the bandits, lie about killing the demons and then call upon the demons with a secret word so that they can aid you in killing the Red Ridgers.
4080:The demons offered a deal, where they will help you to kill the bandits. You said you will consider it.
4081:The demons offered to hide, so that you may lie to the bandits and say you killed them. Go back to the bandit camp. 
4082:You killed the demons as asked. Time to report back to the bandits.
4083:The demons beat you badly and forced you to run away. You can try again, or try another path.
4084:You failed to deal with the demons. You can try again, or try another path.
4085:You arrived at the Red Cave, where the Alchemist awaits.
4086:You tried to get through the barrier, but failed. You need to come back stronger in brawn or magic to try again.
4087:You have entered deeper into the cave, but it holds more mysteries and you need aid to unravel them. You can either choose to rescue an old dwarf from a prison, a tough, but straight forward path. Or, you can look for aid with other factions, the orcs, goblins, dwarves or elves. Seek any of their larger villages and make sure you are friendly before approaching them.
4088:You arrived at the dungeon where the dwarven prisoner is held.
4089:You failed to rescue the dwarf and were forced to leave. Try again, or perhaps look for other paths, the elves, dwarves, goblins or orcs may have some answers for you. Maybe search for their villages.
4090:You rescued the grandmaster, time to return to the Red Cave.
4091:You come to where the dwarven prisoner was supposed to be held, but you find the earth parted and only rabble where the entrance once was.
4092:You returned to the Red Cave after rescuing the grandmaster dwarf.
4093:The Alchemist sent you to find a druid-tree and retrieve its blood so that a new heart may be forged and stabilise the earth.
4094:You find the druid-tree in an old grove.
4095:The druid-tree agreed to sacrifice their own life for your cause. You have the blood so you can return to the Red Cave.
4096:You were tasked with finding a dying druid-tree and end their misery. This way you will also achieve your goal. Search for the forest where the tree is trapped.
4097:The druid-tree did not agree to aid you. You must either force it, or try another path altogether.
4098:You killed the druid-tree and got theblood. Time to return to the Red Cave.
4099:The forest is quiet and ordinary. You walk and walk but do not find traces of the druid-tree anywhere.
4100:You find the place where a dying druid-tree is supposed to be held.
4101:You failed to retrieve the druid-tree's blood. Try again later, or try another path amongst the other factions.
4102:You retrieved the blood of the druid-tree, return to the Red Cave.
4103:But you find nothing of interest here.
4104:You were attacked by lightbringers who wanted to take away the druid blood.
4105:After the fight, you were approached by a group of hooded figures. You decided to move away and do not engage.
4106:You were told that they were the cult of Nyia and that they were the ones led astray and used to destroy the earth-heart that held the ground together. They recognise your mission and wish you well on your path.
4107:You were defeated and the blood stolen! Try to track them down.
4108:You catch the lightbringers who took the druid-blood and one of your people
4109:You retrieve the stolen blood, so you can now go back to the Red Cave.
4110:You decided not to approach for now.
4111:You were badly beaten and forced to flee. You must try again if you want to retrieve the druid blood.
4112:You enter the ancient, underground chamber where four dwarven statues stand guard over the entrance to the heart-chamber.
4113:You defeated the guardians and they bid you to right their wrongs and restore balance. Go back to the Red Cave to complete the stone heart.
4114:You were defeated by the guardians and they bid you return when you are ready.
4115:You finally enter the heart chamber where the light-beast dwells and seeks to escape into the world.
4116:You have defeated the light-zmey! It will take time for Thea to fully absorb the changes your decisions brought, but your task as chosen is done. For now...
4117:The light-zmey defeats you. Return when you are ready to face them again.
4118:You track down a group of mroki. Perhaps you can harvest their hearts for the necromancer.
4119:You defeated the mroki. You can now head to the red cave and meet the necromancer and find your way into the chamber where the light-beast awaits.
4120:The mroki defeated you, but perhaps you can try to track them down again.
4121:The elven mage has confronted you and demands you follow her path.
4122:You agreed to stay on her side and go straight to the zmey cave, and not the Alchemist.
4123:You decided you do not want to follow her path and so you defeated the elf in combat. Seek out another path to end the light-zmey.
4124:You decided you do not want to follow her path and so you tried to kill the mage. She defeated you but allowed you to live. Seek out another path to end the light-zmey.
4125:You visited the Aphaclans and asked for aid in defeating the light-beast.
4126:The orcs were unable to aid you in discovering more about the Red Cave, but they recommended you seek out an orc necromancer, who is known to meddle in many mysteries.
4127:You visited the Spirit Talkers and asked for aid in defeating the light-beast.
4128:The goblins were unable to aid you in discovering more about the Red Cave, but they recommended you seek out an orc necromancer, who is known to meddle in many mysteries.
4129:You visited the necromancer in his tower.
4130:He told you of his design to release the power of darkness, so it may destroy light. You agreed to follow his path. Hunt down some mroki, in the lands of darkness or the volcanic wastelands. Afterwards, meet the necromancer at the cave to defeat the light-beast.
4131:He told you of his design to release the power of darkness, so it may destroy light. You refused to follow his path, and so you must now find another way.
4132:You sought the aid of the dwarves in the fight against the lightbringers.
4133:The Earthbound admitted their shame in failing their duty and allowing the destruction of the earth-heart. They will forge a new heart rune, but you need to go seek out the dziad mroz. The ancient demon dwells in the ice plains.
4134:You found the dziad mroz in his domain of the ice plains.
4135:The ancient demon agreed to hand over the ice drop that you need for the dwarves. You can now return to the cave to fight the light-beast.
4136:You killed the dziad mroz, so you now need to seek another way to deal with the light-beast.
4137:You failed to obtain the ice heart from the dziad mroz, so you now need to seek another way to deal with the light-beast.
4138:You approached the Woodlandkin in search for answers and aid with the lightbringer threat.
4139:A young elven druid, Nai-ysir, told you of how the council is too slow to act. But she also said she knows of an elf mage that may be the cause of all this, thus capturing her and bringing her before the council may secure their aid. Go seek out the rouge mage.
4140:You found the hideout of Ail'yleth, the rogue elven mage.
4141:Ail'yleth tried to sway you to her side, claiming it is time for light to rule. You agreed to follow her path and go seek out a hidden entrance into the heart chamber where the light beast resides.
4142:Ail'yleth tried to sway you to her side, claiming it is time for light to rule. You did not agree, and instead you convinced her balance needs to be served. The mage will join you at the old prison and held rescue the dwarven grandmaster.
4143:Ail'yleth tried to sway you to her side, claiming it is time for light to rule. You refused to listen to her madness and captured her to be taken to back to the elves.
4144:Ail'yleth tried to sway you to her side, claiming it is time for light to rule. You refused her madness, but also failed to capture her. You must seek another way to destroy the light.
4145:You returned the elf mage to the council and they agreed to aid you in destroying the light-beast. The envoy will meet you back at the Red Cave.
4146:You returned the elf mage to the council but they did not agree to aid you. Nai-ysir was angry and decided to join you, but you must now find another way to deal with the light.
4147:You found the entrance to the heart chamber just as Ail'yleth directed you.
4148:The mage joins you and guides you to face some dwarven guardians.
4149:You have defeated the dwarven guardians and aided the light-zmey so that one day, light will rule Thea. For better or worse, you have completed your task.
4150:The dwarven guardians have defeated you, return when you are better prepared.
4151:You entered the heart chamber to face the dwarven guards and aid the light-zmey.
4152:Theodore, a former house demon, now divine messenger, visited you.
4153:He laid out some of the basic rules to survive in this world. His final words were: 'I may pop up now and again to tell you of things, but for now, you must take your first steps into this hostile land. Remember to check for resources on the map for Gathering, set up camp for Craft and Cooking, and check your Inventory to make sure you are well equipped. Here have some wood, so you may heal when camping. My advice is to explore, learn the ropes, and only then decide on a settlement.'
4154:Theodore praised you on your progress with the lightbringers and awarded you a second cosmic seed.
4155:Theodore has once again visited you.
4156:The messenger asked you to find a Slavyan village where an ex-chosen needs to be taught a lesson. you should find the village on your map.
4157:Theodore showed up to give you some more advice.
4158:You were tasked with gathering or cooking some more food, as this is a crucial skill in surviving Thea. He also reminded you that the death of the chosen will mean the end for all.
4159:Theodore showed up again with yet another task.
4160:He was happy with the food and he asked you to visit an old hut nearby.
4161:Theodore showed up again after your meeting with the witch.
4162:He praised you for defeating the hag and said you will make a good chosen. He mentioned he will be back for a final, small task before you are ready for the big stuff.
4163:He was worried you did not do well, but said you have time to get better. He mentioned he will be back for a final, small task before you are ready for the big stuff.
4164:Theodore
4165:You found the village where Theodore sent you.
4166:The villagers gave you the location of Zbigniev, the fallen chosen, but all they could say was 'go that way'. So you must search for him nearby.
4167:You destroyed the village and Theodore seems pleased with the firm message this sends to any other non-believers. He said it is time for him to disappear, he told you to keep an eye out for the lightbringers, and that in time, you find clues to your next task.
4168:You attacked the villagers but failed, you must return when you're better prepared.
4169:You found Zbigniev, the fallen chosen who seemed very angry with the gods.

4211:You have followed the divine path and found Triglav's avatar.
4212:You have followed the divine path and found Zorya's avatar.

4215: You know that you have failed your goddess and you will have to prove your worth with what gifts you already received on this journey.  
4216:The Smith's Legacy
4217:You notice an interesting building nearby.
4218:The place is secluded, but there is smoke coming out and the sounds of a smithy.
4219:You found the forge of Bohdan, the dwarf.
4220:Bohdan asked you to track down his two wayward granddaughters who have run away. He is too old to do it himself and promises a good reward. There are two possible spots on your map where the girls could be.
4221:You killed Bohdan and his troll and you loot the place.
4222:You attacked Bohdan, but he and his troll friend beat you badly and chase you away.
4223:You brought the bad news to Bohdan and he was not happy with you. He told you to leave before he sends his troll friend after you.
4224:You dealt with Bohdan's unruly granddaughters and he was very grateful.
4225:You found the pond where Bohdan's granddaughters may be.
4226:You found the girls and made sure they go back to Bohdan. Go back to the smithy for your reward.

4235:Kurv Game
4236:You were visited by a skshack, Leopold.
4237:The house demon begged for your help else he may be forced to steal from you again. He asked for you to gain entrance into a demon game and win it for him. To do so, you must search for one of his demon friends first and gain their help.
4238:You killed Leopold; he should bother you no more.
4239:You tried to kill it, but you failed. The very surprised house demon escaped.
4240:A hochlick came to you offering a deal.
4241:The hochlick wanted you to kill Leopold the next time he appears, in exchange they will offer a reward. You agreed.
4242:The hochlick wanted you to kill Leopold the next time he appears, in exchange they will offer a reward. You declined.
4243:The hochlick wanted you to kill Leopold the next time he appears, in exchange they will offer a reward. You killed the hochlick.
4244:You killed Leopold and got your reward from the hohlick.
4245:You failed to kill Leopold, he run off and asked you to play the demon game for him anyway. If you visited the dola or cmuch, you will soon find the entrance to the game.
4246:You did not kill Leopold like the hohlick asked, so you still need to play the demon game. If you visited the dola or cmuch, you will soon find the entrance to the game. 
4247:You agreed to sell Leopold into servitude after you win the demon game. In exchange the hochlick will offer a reward. So you must now seek out the game. If you visited the dola or cmuch, you will soon find the entrance to the game. 
4248:The hochlick, Frix, came to you after the game.
4249:You were rewarded for your service.
4250:Leopold visited you after the Kurv Game fiasco.
4251:He said the game was suspended because the demons were shaken by your violent outburst. He left you a thank you gift before moving on.
4252:You entered the Kurv Game.
4253:You killed all the demons, but Leopold seemed very ungrateful and simply run off saying humans are bloody. Still, no more thieving from him.
4254:You tried to kill the demons, but failed badly. You're not sure what happens now.
4255:You won the game and asked for Leopold's freedom. No more thievery and one happy skshack.
4256:You won the game but condemned Leopold to servitude. After all the little bastard stole from you.
4257:You lost the game and so condemned Leopold to further servitude. But it seems you will no longer be bothered by the game, so there's that...
4258:You found the swamp where Leopold's cmuch friend lives.
4259:The demon greed to help, so you must now wait until a doorway into the game appears to you.
4260:You killed the cmuch, so not much chance for his help now... Perhaps Leopold will appear again and offer another option.
4261:You found the house where Leopold's dola friend lives.
4262:You failed to get the dola's help. Perhaps Leopold will appear again and offer another option.
4263:You trusted a demon to aid you, but they tricked you instead and had Leopold condemned to servitude. But the skshack did exlude you from the game at least.
4264:Alphaclans
4265:You have discovered the main settlement of the Alphaclans
4266:The orcs are traditionally a nomadic, clan-based society, rules by clan matriarchs. The alpha matriarch is in charge of all the clans, and it she who holds power in the settled orc villages. Orcs despise cowardice, so think twice before you choose to surrender in their presence. {}{}             Orcs will not typically trade for bone or leather as they usually have it in abundance. When you become friends, you may be able to recruit an orc via the fighting pits. To gain friendship, you can try doing tasks for the Alphas when they are available. 
4267:You have come across an Alphaclans band. This may mean their settlement lies nearby.
4268:Slavyans
4269:You have discovered the main settlement of the Slavyans
4270:The Slavyans are the largest, stable community of humans who like you, worship the Cosmic Tree Pantheon. Some of your own folk have likely come from a Slavyan village before they were thrown into the path of the chosen and forced to forge their own path. Slavyans accept all trade goods, and once friendly, you will be able to recruit up to two humans from the tavern.
4271:You have come across a Slavyan group. This may mean their settlement lies nearby.
4272:Scavengers.
4273:You have discovered the main settlement of the Scavengers
4274:They are the second largest human community, but they are not followers of the pantheon. As the story goes, Scavengers were folk who displeased the gods and thus never received their protection during the days of Darkness. As such, they became wilder, often ridden with disease and madness. These days they are able to form more controlled societies and are known for slave trade across the land. You may be able to acquire some slaves from them, or even sell your own people.
4275:The Glass King
4276:You found the ruins of an old city, covered in ice so clear that it looks almost like glass.
4277:The glass king asked you to help him break a curse by retrieving his beautiful face from a creature that now wears it. The location was marked on your map.
4278:But you were not interested in helping him and left.
4279:You killed the glass king.
4280:You were defeated by the glass king and chased away from his land.
4281:Within, there was a demon-child with the face attached to their body. You convinced the glass king to face the demon child you found, as you suspect it is his own son. The king listened and asked you to come back to him for your reward.
4282:You found the place where the glass king sent you for his face.
4283:Within, there was a demon-child with the face attached to their body. You failed to convince the glass king to face this child, as his own son, and the king decided not to give you any rewards. You left the place.
4284:Within, there was a demon-child with the face attached to their body. You killed the child, and yet the curse remained so the king did not offer any rewards.
4285:You were defeated and get no reward.
4286:You killed the demon-child and carried their body back to the glass king. But upon seeing the body the king wept and exclaimed this was his son. The city turned black and you had to flee.
4287:You return to the ruins of an old city, covered in ice so clear that it looks almost like glass.
4288:The king asked you to stab him through his heart, so that his son may be released from the curse at last. You agreed.
4289:The king asked you to stab him through his heart, so that his son may be released from the curse at last. You declined and left the place.
4290:Fli Catapult

4297:One of the Fli Catapult goblins approached you.
4298:Avix told you the others have moved to a new, secret, location. She thanked you for the potions and left a reward.
4299:You find the cave where you were told to look for a shaman that can give you a potion for the goblin, Khax.
4300:You paid the price the shaman asked for and he promised to deliver the potions to the goblins. Try looking for the Fli Catapult again to get your reward.
4301:You decided the price was too high and abandoned the task.
4302:Vanero
4303:Vanero, the spider silk and robe trader offered his wares to you.
4304:He moved away after you concluded your business.

4306:You tried to kill him but you were defeated and had to pay for your attack.
4307:You met a young girl, Suri.
4308:She asked you to avenge her family and you agreed to help her. She said she will lead you to where the murderers are.
4309:She asked you to avenge her family but it turned out you already killed the murderers - they were the robe traders. Suri gave you a reward and left.
4310:She asked you to avenge her family but you were not interested and left.
4311:Led by Suri, you tracked down her family's murderers and it turned out it was Vanero, the trader.
4312:You killed Vanero and Suri was very grateful you took her side despite her beast nature.
4313:You killed Suri and Vanero was grateful you stood with humans.
4314:You decided this was none of your business and left.
4315:You convinced the two sides to talk and find common ground. They were grateful for your insight and managed a dialogue.
4316:You fought and lost and you were forced to flee, so you never did find out how the conflict ended.
4317:Father's choice
4318:You came across a small hamlet where a father was about to kill his cursed daughter.
4319:But you decided to leave.
4320:You killed the villagers and you decided to take on the cursed girl yourself, claiming you can handle it. Zloslava is now your problem, or blessing, depending on how fate will see it.
4321:You killed the villagers and you decided to leave the girl behind.
4322:You tried to kill the villagers, but failed and had to run away.
4323:You assisted the father in cleansing the curse, he was very grateful to you that his daughter is now free, even if she is not alive.
4324:You allowed the father to kill the cursed child and the villagers were grateful you did not interfere.
4325:You tried to cleanse the curse from the child, but failed to do it properly and so the child became a wraith.
4326:Sea Heaven
4327:You came across a shipwreck with a female floating atop a raft, clutching a golden treasure chest. She called out for help.
4328:But you decided to ignore her.
4329:But a kraken devoured her and you did not pursue.
4330:She told you of the treasure chest and how it must be taken to her home, or else her people will suffer. But a kraken devoured her. You decided to try and track the beast to see if you can help and you think you can find where it went once you land on the shore.
4331:But a kraken devoured her and you could not pursue.
4332:You found the kraken who kidnaped a girl at sea.

4554:Dzievanna
4555:I walk in the watchful shadow of the old mother earth who lies silent. I listen to her whispers and sing her songs. Mistress of the forests, spirit of nature, lady of the earth - those are the names mortals call me. But do not be fooled by the beauty of my domain, by the desire to uphold life and treasure balance above all.{}{}Nature is not your calmly mother. Cross my path in defiance of the eternal laws and you will learn the fury of the forests. For I am also the huntress. Silent and vigilant, true to my cause and unwavering in my resolve. Defile my domain at your own peril and taste the whisper of the forest at your shoulder before death comes for you!{}{}Walk with me amongst the trees if you dare.
4556:Horz
4557:From the shadows of the night and the terrors of darkness ever lurking in the corners, I rise! Reborn anew in the weaves of the moon's magic, I stand as the master of the night and keeper of the moon. Monsters and beasts, demons and fiends they all roam my domain. It is up to me to keep them in check to rule, dominate and destroy those who disobey!{}{}I am a shadow stalker, a howler in the night. I run with the wolves and dance with the stars. I rule the dark to make sure the light does not conquer all. It is a task unloving, lonesome and cruel, but it is a path I will walk for as long as the moon hangs in the skies.{}{}Do not fear the darkness, master it!
4558:Lada
4559:I was born in the darkest hour of our land, from the seed of hope held in the hearts of our people. The long night sought to diminish all light and love from our hearts, but it could not do so. In the absence of the father who once led us and the mother who was our keeper, I now stand at the head of our pantheon, so that hope remains in the times of the ever-persistent turmoil.{}{}Mistake me not for a fragile flower seeking only the fertile ground to spawn its seeds. Beauty and hope can yet turn their blossoming petals into shards of steel and thunder when the time is right. The path of peace is rarely peaceful.{}{}But if your heart beats strong and your will is made of iron, join me on the road to harmony.
4560:Marovit
4561:Wisdom and knowledge flow in unsteady currents through our world, and I am their student. I seek no dominance, nor claim to hold the reins of such rivers, no. The mind and the soul will forever remain mysteries and we, be it mortals or eternals, we can only gaze upon the surface of the great oceans of understanding.{}{}Spirit walker, sage, keeper of the keys of knowledge and mysticism - those are the names childishly attached to my domains. I am but a mere servant of the wills of the ocean, a lone sailor seeking to enlighten others. Mortals forget that they are not the masters of our lands, they forget or reject it, but I am here to remind them all of the power of the otherworlds.{}{}Seek wisdom, fear not the unknown, wield the weaves of magic as your sword.
4562:Nyia
4563:Forgotten, abandoned, diminished, alone... For centuries I was but a mere memory... Nay not even that. But the lady of winter is no more, the master of the underworlds is gone. And finally, I take my place once more. Mistress of death, bringer of sorrow, keeper of solace and demise.{}{}Only I can traverse the lands of the dead - the navyas, only I can carry the souls of the faithful to their homes and peace. Yet it is not a service well received. I do not mourn for the dead, I do not weep for the dying, it is all as it should be, as it was made to be - and sometimes, when the laws are broken, death will be served by my hand. I have suffered in the darkness. Now I bring suffering and its end, infinitely.{}{}Join me? Why would you, fool?
4564:Stribog
4565:The world has shattered, earth has moved and oceans flooded our homes. No longer can we stay in one place, we must move, conquer, explore! From the winds of the north I bear the ice will to fight. From the winds of the west I will bless your travels with swiftness. From the currents of the east I will whisper wisdom and from the warm embrace of the southern breeze I will give comfort on your journey forwards.{}{}I was once a spirit of the winds, free, wild and untamed - but I heard the call of the cosmic tree as the earth crumbled beneath it. I was called by my brothers and sisters, I was called by my people who raised their hands to the skies and asked for good winds. I am now the god of the journey, a pathfinder, a path giver and guide.{}{}Come with me into the winds and know true freedom.
4566:Svarog
4567:From the flames of the sky and the ashes of darkness past, I rise to my duty! Sun god and master of heavenly fires - that is my honour to bear. But as I once wielded a warrior's garb I now know the true power of light and fire, the simple hearth that lights the homes and hearts of my flock.{}{}It is not the power of the gods that will save our lands, but the power we can grant to our faithful. In the scorching flames of my domain rise the tools and weapons of true heroes, mortals and immortals alike, sworn to uphold my iron will.{}{}Protect those in need, never back down, never give in and never again allow darkness to rule over light!
4568:Triglav
4569:Argh! From the scorching lava seeping out of the ashes of our land, I was forged! Veins of wrath pulsate thought my body with rage and purpose. My stone hearts beat in unison, my minds meld into one vision, my fists are driven trifold. I do not know who raised me from the darkness. I do not know why our hearts melt with anger, but I am ready to stand and fight against any who will dare to oppose us!{}{}A new force rises to devour Thea once again and I will stand in its way. This is why I have risen from fire. Walk with me into war, burn our enemies to the ground, melt away those who seek to wound us, crush whoever stands in the path of divine justice and wrath.{}{}And you? You are to bow before me and obey!
4570:Zorya
4571:My father claims the right to be master of light and the sun, but it is we who ride the night skies in their infinity! The morning star rises far and faded, it is subtle and ever watchful of her enemies. The noon star hangs low and heavy, ready to rush into combat and devour its enemies. The evening star lights up the skies and readies for war! Zorya, Zorza, the Auroras, all names given to us by those brave enough to follow!{}{}I am the bright blade of the night and the shining gauntlet of the day. I hold the beast that would devour our world in my palm and I laugh in the face of the enemy. Be bold, be brutal and swift.{}{}Enemies of balance grow in strength once more, I will tear them apart and devour their entrails! Join me!

4803:Resources
4804:There are different types of {}resources{} in the world. They can be used as {}crafting materials, food or fuel{}, but before your people can use them - they need to collect them.
4805:Resources are shown on the world map as special objects such as plants, animals, bones etc.
4806:Move your group near a tile with a resource located no further than one hex away.{}{}To assign your workers to collecting resources, your group has to be in {}Camp Mode.{}

4820:How quickly a card will act depends on the Delay value {} of the skill they use and also on their Wits {} attribute.
4821:The outcome of the {}Fight phase{} will decide if another Round is needed. The challenge will last for as long as both players have cards to play during the Preparation phases.
4822:Equipment
4823:Recipe
4824:A character's {}equipment{} greatly influences how well they perform during a challenge and what {}skills{} they can use.
4825:Skills available to the character are either learned or gained from equipped items. How effective they are depends on the character's attributes.{}{}For example, if a skill relies on Perception ({}), a character with a higher Perception will be more effective with that skill.

4832:{}Step 3/5{} - Select a skill for the item.{}{}Some skills require a particular type of essence. The more essence your materials provide, the more powerful the skill will be.
4833:{}Step 4/5{} - Preview your item.{}{}This window shows the details of your item. You can add it to {}Favourites{} list to easily retrieve it later. Click the star to do so.

4985:The challenge screen consists of:
4986:- {}Hand{} - these are your cards,
4987:- {}Battlefield{} - where you and your enemy place the cards you want to play,
4988:- {}Sequence Bar{} - shows order of actions,
4989:- {}Turn Indicators{} - status of the current round.
4990:You and your enemy take turns to play your cards during {}Preparation Turns.{}
4991:Your Turns
4992:Enemy Turns
4993:All actions are placed in a queue (Sequence Bar shows the order) and executed later, in Fight Turns.
4994:Playing a card  for the first time costs 1 Action Point ({}).
4995:{}To play a card:{}
4996:1. Click on a card on your Hand.{}2. Select an action.{}3. Click on a slot on the Battlefield.
4997:Show Me
4998:When you spend your APs ({}), end your turn and your enemy will have a chance to perform their actions.
4999:Each of you will have a total of {}4 Preparation Turns{} and you will get APs ({}) at the start of each turn.
5000:You can play the same character more than once.
5001:Each time you play the same character, its AP  cost increases by {}1.
5002:You will see a {}Clone{} icon on each card that has been played more than once.
5003:Its colour will be different if cloned units are different.
5004:Each action that targets one of the Clones will have effect on all of them.
5005:When the Preparation Turns end, {}Fight Turns{} begin.
5006:Characters will exchange blows and perform actions according to the order on the {}Sequence Bar.{}
5007:Actions with lowest {}Delay{} ({}) will be performed first.
5008:If there is no winner after the first round, another round will start.
5009:The challenge will last until either you or your enemy lose all their characters.

5020:Click your Middle Mouse Button (or use the scroll wheel) to zoom onto a card if you want to see additional info about it.
5021:This challenge is much more difficult - your Warrior does not really specialise in Spiritual challenges.
5022:In a case where a victory is not likely, it might be a good idea to run away.
5023:Click the {}Forfeit Challenge{} button and confirm your decision on the popup.
5024:Your warrior may suffer some damage and/or the story will react to your action, but sometimes it is better to run and live than to fight and die.

5029:This is a {}Challenge vs Concept{}. In challenges vs Concept you cannot use skills that come from equipped items. In other words - only your natural abilities count here.
5030:If your characters do not have a suitable skill that can be used in a challenge they are in, they will be able to use a default attack, but it is not very effective.
5031:Losing (or forfeiting) a challenge against a concept may also have bad consequence, but it usually doesn't affect your characters' hit points.
5032:By the way - during Fight Turns you will see Animation Speed slider appear in this spot.
5033:It allows you to change how fast the fight and attack effects are played.
5034:In this fight your characters have some items at their disposal.
5035:Items come with different skills and using them correctly will improve your chance of winning.
5036:Skills may have different usage rules that define what they can target, when their effects are triggered and what kind of effect is applied at the time they are triggered.
5037:When deciding on which skill to use, hover over each icon to see how the skill works.
5038:For example - the {}Wand{} held by {}Anya{} is a {}ranged weapon{}. You can only use it from your {}ranged row{}.
5039:Ranged weapons can target any enemy character, unless there is one standing in the melee row in front of its user, blocking their view.
5040:You will be able to pick a target during Fight Turns. However, if Anya gets blocked by an enemy, this enemy must be targeted.
5041:{}Kamil{} holds a scroll with {}Lullabye{} skill. Using it will {}instantly{} increase Delay ({}) of an enemy character on the Battlefield, causing them to act later than they would normally do.
5042:Unlike weapon attacks, instant skills apply their effect when you confirm the target(s).

5048:Oh dear, these bandits don't stand a chance against the pure awesomeness of your dwarves.
5049:Let's use this fight as an opportunity to explain Shielding, True and Splash Damage.
5050:{}Shielding{} protects your characters' hit points and normally is taken off first. It is replenished between challenges but not between rounds.
5051:One of your dwarves is carrying {}a shield{}, which allows him to protect another ally by increasing their Shielding.
5052:He also carries a Hatchet, which deals an improved version of {}True Damage{} ({}). Not only will your dwarf deal full damage to hit points, but also deal the same amount of damage to the enemy's Shielding.
5053:Your other dwarf is equipped with a Mallet. This is a slow, but a rather powerful weapon that does {}Splash Damage{} ({}). It will damage enemies that stand next to your character's main target.
5054:Hover your mouse over a character on the Battlefield to see their target(s).
5055:If {}Clones{} are standing next to each other, they will all be affected by the splash and receive a lot more damage.
5056:Try to take advantage of this fact when playing a splash damage skill and be careful how you place your units if you suspect an enemy might have a splash damage weapon.
