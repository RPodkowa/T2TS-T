6001:Tell them your old pack is dead, and you go with the god folk now. But ask what they need help with.
6002:'Much was taken from us, and we weak, no more strong ones to fight to take back. Can you help?'
6003:Why should you?
6004:Say you will consider it, but ask her to speak quickly. [SKIP STORY]
6005:'Your bodies look well-fleshed, your eyes speak of food and clean water. We had no such luck. Our grandfathers and their grandfathers before them, they all sick, they weak, they die.'
6006:Yes, you know the dark night well. Our grandfathers banished to walk the land, the sick rivers, the ailing forests, the cursed meats. We lived, but weak and flesh-ill or mind-itched. What of it?
6007:No, you do not recall the darkest night.
6008:'My family is growing weaker still. The Shattering took our homes again. Your good-flesh folk kill us, your gods leave us to rot. But my kid, my kid was born good-flesh, maybe this brings hope?'
6009:And someone took them?
6010:Why ask you to do it, why not do themselves?
6011:'Yes, yes, the other pack, the red ridgers, over the peak there. They took them and took many man-folk, we too weak now...{}{}{}{}If you do this, we have a way into this cave of yours, yes we do!'
6012:What's in it for you?
6013:Kidnapping children is a filthy deed. Agree to try to help.
6014:Why you? Why not do it themselves?
6015:'My younger daughter, Monia, she not so ill, she will birth you children. And we have goods we will give, not so much, most was taken, we have not much... and that cave of yours, you'll be free to go in, no?'{}{}{}{}She gestures towards a pale, thin girl with saggy breasts and bulging abdomen, looking up at you without emotion. 
6016:Agree to look for the child and take Monia when you succeed.
6017:She doesn't look very happy about it. Ask her if she's okay with the deal.
6018:Well, she looks miserable, so at least she can leave here. Agree to look for the child.
6019:[Scavenger]Take a closer look at your hosts.
6020:Say that you will not help in this odd saga. Tell them to leave as agreed, then go report back to the bandits that you solved the problem.
6021:'Oh, good, good. You strange people, but good. How odd that is... {}{}{}{}Them bandits, they talk to you, they think you work for them, you give them this - my rod. You say you kill me, and you poison the buggers! Or just steal our kin back, or slaughter them. Either way, you get your cave, I promise.'{}{}
6022:Leave to face the bandits.
6023:'Happy? And? She birthed two whelps already, both died, but third time lucky, eh?'{}{}{}{}The girl herself does not speak.
6024:You remember the harsh ways of your kind, but you left that life. {}{}{}{}Most people here carry illness of the body and mind, and women are kept as breeding stock. You remember raids where you were sent out to capture healthy women from others. Still, you know this is their way of life, so the girl will come willingly -- or rather, she has no will left to oppose.
6025:This is all foul business. Selling off their own kin as cattle. Purge this place, and kill all the leaders and guards!
6026:'You one of us, no? You know the shit we eat and live. A good-flesh child is good omen, will bring us health.'
6027:Ask why their chief isn't here to ask, just her.
6028:Say you'll consider it, but what is your reward?
6029:She frowns at you and wipes snot off her face. 'The chief is angry, out looking for Basha. You come, I speak. Boss listens to his breeder wife.'
6030:You attack, seeking to kill only those in charge, but you soon realise that everyone stands in defence of the settlement, even the children.
6031:If they all wish to die, then they'll all die. Attack!
6032:Ask why they defend those who hurt them.
6033:Monia, the promised breeder, speaks to you in reply:{}{}{}{}'This is home, you know this...'
6034:Nod in resignation and say you will look for the boy.
6035:'Good, good, thank you! Go, go kill them and bring our kid!'{}{}
6036:You kill the scavenger guards, and those who survived flee in terror, cursing your name and all your gods.{}{}{}{}The hovel they left behind doesn't promise much, but you are free to search it and report your success to the bandits.
6037:Gather what you can find and leave.
6038:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, leaving much of your belongings behind.
6039:'You again! You're either brave or dumbass, either way, time to die!'
6040:The woman in charge spits and curses the bandits:{}{}{}{}'You good-flesh folks, you never too clever. But I guess I was wrong about you. Be thanking you. We go, quickly!' 
6041:Wait for them to leave, then report your success to the bandits.
6042:'Fast as I can. Those red-ridge buggers, them took our children, last healthy boy we had. {}{}{}{}You stick them, stick them hard for us, find our boy, we reward you. We give you bride, we give you goods, and you get rid of scum and go to your cave.'
6043:No. You came here to do a job, so attack!
6044:'It was before the Awakening, before the sun came back and the gods woke up. Them gods did not care for all, no. Us, we were left to fend for ourselves and the dark ate our flesh and spirit, yes it did.'
6045:'So, you got our young one, or maybe the bastards are dead'uns? Eh?'
6046:Killed the bandits.
6047:Got the child.
6048:Neither, they beat you.
6049:Attack the scavengers!
6050:Tell them you need more time. Leave.
6051:'Bah, I be damned to all hells and kiss Nyia's arse for eternity! You went and did it. {}{}{}{}Deal's a deal, we stay away from that cave, you go do what you want with it. We go have us a party now, you come drink with us, you take Monia!'
6052:Thank her and accept the reward.
6053:Say you'd rather not take Monia, but thank her all the same. 
6054:'Well, I be damned for sure, you did it! Come here, child... eh, think it's ours. No matter, looks good-flesh, we take it.'
6055:Does she not know whether this is her child? She made it sound like it was important earlier.
6056:'Well, all are mine, as I am the boss mamma, but its brood mamma died of the rot, and I never pay much attention to the whelps till they good for somethin', but this will do. Deal's a deal, here, I show you a passage to the cave you want. I warn you, those bandits will soon know you made deals with us, you best stay away from them.{}{}{}{}Oh, and take Monia, as promised, she good to you. Now best go.'
6057:Thank her and go find the cave.
6058:'She be good to you, don't beat her much and we good. Now go, see your cave and make flesh-healthy sprogs. Now we go drink!'
6059:Party with the scavengers before leaving.
6060:'Ah, I see. Well, no other way now for you than keep trying to kill them lot, that way we get revenge and you get your cave. Good luck.'
6061:'Bah, I guess you right, she ugly as my butt. Go, see your cave and make flesh-healthy sprogs. But now we go drink!'
6062:You see the remains of a scavenger settlement, it is destroyed. perhaps the bandits decided to deal with them after all.
6063:You track the thieves to this location and find an old abandoned ruin of a house. 
6064:Go in, arms at the ready.
6065:As you come in closer, you sense the unmistakable presence of a demon here.
6066:Greet him and say that you are here to talk, not play games or fight.
6067:Shout and tell the creature to give back your stuff!
6068:A creature lurks under the remains of the front door. He skulks at you, then repeats in a mocking tone:{}{}{}{}'Hello there, creature, I wish you no harm. Let's talk.'{}{}
6069:Sigh and say that he must be one of 'those' demons.
6070:Tell him to stop, immediately!
6071:[Demon]His tongue is riddled, likely bound by demon lore. Make him a deal of your own: tell him a riddle, and if he fails to answer, he must speak to you.
6072:'Oh crap, you're one of those...'
6073:You know some demon lore, so speak the words: 'I curse you thrice, I bless you twice, and so I pay the speaker's price. Be free to speak to me.'
6074:Beat the creature up and tell him to give up your goods!
6075:'Stop it immediately!'
6076:The demon lets out a sigh of great relief, but he still looks nervous:{}{}{}{}'You called the lore, I am unbound, for now. Speak quickly, for it does not last much...'
6077:Did he mean long?
6078:Ask after your things.
6079:The creature shrugs:{}{}{}{}'I meant much, but long will be. What do you want of I?'
6080:'If I did I cannot say. I do what I don't. I am bound to serve, so bad light does not catch me.'
6081:But he is a hahalek, a house demon. Why would he leave his house and steal from folk?
6082:The hahalek looks saddened:{}{}{}{}'I was, twice... The earth shakes, houses die and bad light hurts us. I bound myself to other services, I cannot say less?'{}{}
6083:Did he mean more? Never mind. Ask if you can take back your things. He doesn't need to be involved, thus he's not breaking his laws.
6084:'Oh... hmmm... I am no guardian demon, was bound to take and carry it to the masters, not to guard...'
6085:Take your things from the house.
6086:You take stolen goods you find inside the house. There is some extra, clearly taken from others. {}{}{}{}You see a lot of torn-out feathers and fur and specks of blood in the house, and when you look at the hahalek, you see it does look very patchy.
6087:Tell him you have your things back, so you will not kill him, but he had better not steal from you again.
6088:Ask the demon why he is bound like this. He does not seem happy or well.
6089:'I thank me. I cannot promise. You see, masters, they make the rules, and me, I work.'{}{}{}{}The creature skulks away.
6090:A creature lurks under the remains of the front door. He skulks at you, then repeats in a mocking tone:{}{}{}{}'Give back what is ours, now!'{}{}
6091:The creature looks perplexed and tries to break your riddle, but he cannot do it. He squirms and squirms but fails the task.
6092:Tell him a deal is a deal, so now he must speak to you.
6093:'I curse you thrice, I bless you twice, and so I pay the speaker's price. Be free to speak to me.'{}{}{}{}It doesn't look like you're getting anywhere with the creature.{}{}
6094:It was a hassle to capture the hahalek, but you finally do it, and now he lies at your mercy.{}{}{}{}It is quiet for once.
6095:[Demon or zerca]Call upon demon lore -- a life spared is a life bound. Now, this deal does not work on all demons, but try it anyway.
6096:Spare him and just take back your stuff.
6097:'Unbound I am and yet tangled. I cannot serve you, so I may scream now? Speak quick for my tongue is not free for much.'
6098:Did he mean he is not free for long?
6099:As the creature dies, he utters a curse:{}{}{}{}'Be it night, be it day, my spirit will stay.'{}{}
6100:You fail to catch the creature and he runs away. Worse yet, your equipment is nowhere to be seen.
6101:'I unsaid, the ground shook, broke houses, new job. I am no sad, no happy, I am.'
6102:Nod, wish him well, and leave.{}
6103:You come to a place torn up by tremors. Surrounded by deep chasms in the ground lies a small patch of swamp. Within sits what looks like a very large toad, perched on a water lily leaf. It croaks a sad melody.
6104:[Cmuch]This one looks familiar. Hop over to the toad.
6105:This is most likely a cmuch, a shy swamp demon with a reputation for appearing to lazy or weakened folk and draining their lives. {}{}
6106:Consider the true demon lore.
6107:You know this reputation to be false. The creature is in fact drawn to illness and despair and driven to take them upon itself. As a result, the demon is misshapen, forever suffering.{}{}{}{}This one, however, looks unusual. It has golden scales along its neck and long crystal eyelashes that flicker with light with every move. {}{}
6108:Ask your demon kin if he is all right.
6109:The creature turns to you and speaks, his voice surprisingly clear and melodic:{}{}{}{}'Oh, oh. You see me! Oh no... but then... maybe you could...'
6110:'A cmuch, I am. I have no name, I think... not that I can recall. Although now that you mention it, it seems like I should. Hmmm.{}{}{}{}Have you seen my swamp? I lost it...'
6111:How can one lose a swamp?
6112:Say that you have little time to talk. Does he need any help?
6113:'The earth shook, the holes came, and the swamp was gone. Then everyone left, only me, alone here. And I cannot stomp on dry land, you see. But I know someone who can help. Will you carry me to her?'
6114:[Cmuch]A fellow cmuch in need? Yes, agree to help.
6115:Tell him that it smells like a trick.
6116:'Great, it isn't far, only there.{}{}{}{}And because you were so kind, here - I hear my spit is good for healing and other stuff.'{}{}{}{}The toad-like creature croaks and spits a green, smelly ball of goo and hands it to you. 
6117:Thank him.
6118:'No trick, I swear! I am no trickster demon, you know. But a demon, yes, we are bound by deals we make. So you take me to Dobra's hut, and I give you my golden scales, deal?'
6119:Deal.
6120:A demon deal for his healing spit, sure. Agree.
6121:'Yes, so I hear. Fine. So, deal?'{}{}{}{}The toad-like creature croaks and spits a green, smelly ball of goo and hands it to you. 
6122:You take a few shots at the creature and feel a weave of magic growing. It is not strong, but it will hit you soon!
6123:Fight the magic!
6124:The magic subsides, and in place of the toad lies the body of a young woman, naked, wearing only a golden necklace and a delicate crystal tiara on her head. The body slowly sinks into the swamp.
6125:Try to take the tiara and necklace.
6126:You manage to grab the goods before the body sinks into the mud. The tiara turns to water in your hand, but the remains of the golden necklace look interesting.{}{}
6127:This is your own kin, a cmuch. But you see that it is odd. It has golden scales on its neck and its eyelashes seem to be made of crystal. {}{}{}{}It is also unusual for your kin to be sitting in plain sight like this.
6128:Ask him what he is doing here. Why isn't he hiding?
6129:'Oh, oh, a cmuch, yes? I thought all were gone! But... you're not the one I met here before... they are all gone, and I cannot leave on dry land!'
6130:What does he mean he can't leave?
6131:'No, no, I cannot, I tried...'{}{}{}{}The cmuch hops up to the swamp, and jumps in and out. All seems fine.
6132:Tell him this is all very odd.
6133:'Great, it isn't far, only there.{}{}{}{}And because you were so kind, here - I will share my spit with you and also give you my golden scale!
6134:Thank him and move out.
6135:'I am fine, I think. I have no name, or do I? Although now that you mention it, it seems like I should. Hmmm.{}{}{}{}Have you seen my swamp? I lost it...'
6136:'Hmm, yes, I think. Take me to my friend. She lives in a house, a strange house, over there.'
6137:The cmuch directs you to an old straw hut sitting on a chicken leg, surrounded by low-hanging mist and the smell of baked cookies and burnt sugar.
6138:[Wisdom]This certainly looks like a witch's hut -- could even be a baba yaga. Shout at the toad for leading you here!
6139:This doesn't look friendly. Approach cautiously. 
6140:The cmuch looks scared by your outburst. He gets nervous hiccups:{}{}{}{}'What's a baba yaga? Hick... the lady there? Hick... She is good, she helps us...'{}{}{}{}You feel you are being watched.
6141:Tell whoever resides within the hut that the toad seems to think they will help, and you wish no conflict.
6142:[Magic user]Say that whatever tricks are at work here, you are no fool. You wish only to hand over the toad.
6143:[Baba Yaga]Tell your sister to stop messing around and let you in. Ask why this toad thinks she's a friend.
6144:'Oh, you do, do you now? Ha ha. Very well. No funny business with you, then. {}{}{}{}You should not linger here, stranger. Leave the toad to my care and go.'
6145:How did the other demons disappear?
6146:Leave the toad and swear at the lost time.
6147:'The light came. Earth parted once more and this time, it was not empty inside. {}{}{}{}All who see it are taken or destroyed. No in between with that lot...'
6148:The light did it?
6149:How sad. Now, is there a reward for this toad?
6150:'That is what I said and saw. A light so bright, it is darkness. If it finds you lacking, you wither away and become air. It devours, it takes, it does not need or want, it does only as it will.'
6151:If it wills, it wants, surely?
6152:'Perhaps. All I know is the demons were there one day, then they all changed, filled to the brim, overflowing inside, driven by emptiness, driven to walk away from their nature.'
6153:A force took control of the demons from the swamp? So how is she still here?
6154:'A force, perhaps. They saw the light and are gone. {}{}{}{}My hut knows how to hide, so we hid, we watched, we waited. Me and the toad, the only ones left.'
6155:So she has magic protecting her, but the cmuch?
6156:'The cmuch? Oh, the toad. Well, it is not as it seems. {}{}{}{}Hmm, it was there, in the middle, saw it all. I doubt its tiny mind comprehends, but if you take its curse away, maybe it could tell you more.'
6157:What curse?
6158:All right, whatever this curse is, agree to try to break it.
6159:'It is not a cmuch, obviously. It is a cursed thing, and that is why it stayed. The light was too weak to break it, to take it. That is good, or is it?'
6160:Is she asking you?
6161:'Not really, no. But you must know, demons are made of magic. We are bound to it, bound to laws stronger than our own will. We cannot break those bonds, not without other bonds, prices, deals, tricks. Those who left, they just left - how?'
6162:'All right, so you say the toad could tell us more. Can you break its curse? Do we kiss it or something?'
6163:You walk towards the house, but within a few minutes you realise you aren't getting any closer. The voice of an old woman speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'What do you seek here, strangers?'
6164:Answer that the toad asked you to bring him here because all his other friends are gone.
6165:'Yes, yes, gone they are! All of them...'
6166:How? Why? Does she know?
6167:'Kiss it, kiss it... yes. That will work.'
6168:[Magic user]The kiss will connect us with the curse and then we can try to break free together, yes?
6169:A kiss? How is that going to work?
6170:'Ah, clever... dangerous... clever you are... I was going to ask for payment, but I see I'm dealing with professionals. So let us just do it, yes?'
6171:Nod in agreement for now.
6172:'All who wish to partake will lick the toad three times, then take the sweat from their armpits and mark the creature's face with it. This way I will join you all. The curse will then attack you too. If you succeed, you may break it!'
6173:[Demon]And if you fail?
6174:And if you fail?
6175:And why doesn't she do it?
6176:'You're a demon like me, so you risk getting some of the curse on you.'
6177:Perform the ritual kiss.
6178:Refuse, leave the toad to the yaga and go.
6179:'You will likely be stung by the magic, but nothing more.'
6180:'I am a demon, and the curse is of demon origin, so it may hurt me more than you.'
6181:[Demon]Remind her that so are you.
6182:'A reward? Hardly! Why should I pay for a stinking toad? But leave him here, if you like. It's gotten lonely lately.{}{}{}{}I see you are impatient, so I will say it fast. The earth broke, light came out, it was blinding. Do you want to know more?'
6183:No, leave the toad and swear at the lost time.
6184:'Then all the demons and creatures from the swamp either died or left. The toad is a witness, but he is stupid in this form, so if you want to learn more, you will need to break the curse first.'
6185:Refuse. Tell her it's time for you to go.
6186:Agree to give it a go.
6187:The curse breaks, and the cmuch turns into a tall young man with golden fins and gills. His eyes sparkle like gems.{}{}{}{}'Thank the waters! That was insufferable!'
6188:Ask if he's a prince.
6189:'A what now? Why would you ask such a thing?'
6190:Tell him the story of the frog and prince.
6191:Never mind. Ask him what he is.
6192:'I am a vodnik. I was, well, I was courting a rusalka, and it's strictly forbidden, you see... Anyway, her slimy sister turned me into the dumb creature.' 
6193:Ask why she cursed him.
6194:'Well, how about that. The rusalka who cursed me was a young witch before she was gifted with water-life. She must have thought it funny, the bitch!'
6195:'Eh, I tried to get it on with another rusalka. It is forbidden, but, well, I am a prince, I suppose you could say. My father is the vodnik who rules over our waters. So I thought I could get away with it.'
6196:Prince, then, after all? Ask for a reward.
6197:'Yes, yes.'{}{}{}{}He looks playfully at you.{}{}{}{}'So your story speaks of marriage to the prince, right? Or kissing at least? Yeah, no marriage, but I am willing to give you my lips and more, for a night...'{}{}
6198:Agree, spend some time with the vodnik.
6199:Politely decline. But insist he pays his dues for the rescue.
6200:'Yes, yes. I am not going to marry one of your rugged lot - you can forget that. But I can give you a few trinkets in thanks.' {}{}
6201:Ask about the disappearing demons.
6202:Demand more.
6203:'Hmm. It's all so very foggy, my dear. The cmuch was so undignified and dumb.{}{}{}{}I felt a touch of something. It was burning, yet ice cold. Light but in its purest, raw form. It spoke of unison, order, ultimate peace. It sought to touch me, but the curse kept me hidden. The others, they were not so lucky...{}{}{}{}I saw them walk so straight, so depleted of life, yet living. They went towards one of the chasms left by the Shattering, then they were gone.'
6204:Ask him to join you.
6205:'I am getting irked with your tone. But you saved me, so I'll let it pass.'
6206:Kill the ungrateful wretch!
6207:You kill the vodnik without trouble. The witch who stood watching speaks:{}{}{}{}'Well, that defeated the purpose of getting information. I am off now. Good luck to you.'
6208:Stop her and demand more answers!
6209:'I have none, as I said! This was the only lead. Just keep your eyes open. I am sure this isn't the only place where demons disappeared.' 
6210:'Stinking fools, meddling in my business, then this! You're lucky I am no dark demon!'
6211:'Oh, that's sweet, but no.'
6212:Try to convince him.
6213:Say your farewells.
6214:The witch who came with you waves goodbye as well:{}{}{}{}'Off I go, then. Did my bit. Hope you get 'em, whoever "them" are...'
6215:Say goodbye and leave.
6216:'You have a silver tongue, I'll give you that. I shan't join you, but you can call upon my minions for help when you're in trouble. Farewell. May all the toads turn to princes for you!'
6217:Wish him well and leave.{}
6218:A baba yaga appears, smiles, and embraces you:{}{}{}{}'A yaga, yes! We who are taken by madness should stick together, eh? The toad, yes, you can leave with me, if you like?'
6219:Ask her why this toad is the only demon in the swamps.
6220:'Ha ha. No threats, no negotiations, just gave me the toad. Odd folk.{}{}{}{}Here, have a gift for your troubles and go away.'
6221:The toad is slimy and stinks of the bog. It croaks at you and looks confused:{}{}{}{}'Ehm, hi there. Do I know you?'{}{}{}{}The yaga shrugs and takes the toad away:{}{}{}{}'You tried. Bye.'
6222:'I never could refuse a pretty face... that's what got me into this mess, I suppose. Still, one never learns, it seems. {}{}{}{}Here's my reward, and fare thee well, my lovely friend. If ever you come by my pond, please visit. And do stay away from the wretched light!'
6223:Try to convince him to stay with you.
6224:'Ah, a wise one, or whatnot. Me, I am a simple demon, a yaga. But that is of no concern to you. {}{}{}{}This here little fella's the only one left of our demons from the swamps, so leave him with me and be on your way, no tricks from me, swear.'
6225:'I take a wee bit of your blood, then you kiss the toad and I prepare a ritual. You will need to have a strong spirit to help break the curse.'
6226:Decline. She isn't getting any of your blood!
6227:'Oh, fine, fine, don't need it. Just kiss the toad, face the music, that's all.'
6228:'I never could refuse a pretty face... that's what got me into this mess, I suppose. Still, one never learns, it seems. {}{}{}{}Here's my reward, and fare thee well, my lovely friend. If ever you come by my pond, please visit. And do stay away from the wretched light!'{}{}{}{}Your time together was great, but later you find yourself feeling a bit fishy...
6229:Take your leave.
6230:'I never could refuse a pretty face... that's what got me into this mess, I suppose. Still, one never learns, it seems. {}{}{}{}Here's my reward, and fare thee well, my lovely friend. If ever you come by my pond, please visit. And do stay away from the wretched light!'{}{}{}{}Your time together proved magical, and you feel your destiny strengthened by it.
6231:You kill the demon and her body withers away.{}{}
6232:Shaken in your sleep, you wake to find yourself fallen from a hammock onto dry, brittle soil. 
6233:What hammock? Look around.
6234:Stand up fast and be ready for trouble!
6235:Accept your divine role as chosen. [Skip story]
6236:Dazed and displaced, your eyes glaze over a land steeped in dark shadows.{}{}{}{}There is no hammock, no sign of your camp. But there is a dim light flickering ahead. 
6237:Follow it.
6238:You stand ready for battle but realize your body is weak and worn out. {}{}{}{}The land beneath your feet is scorched and the air heavy with a dark mist. But there is a dim light flickering ahead. 
6239:You walk towards the light, and with every step, the shadows part beneath your feet and a path is revealed. 
6240:Walk it.
6241:Avoid the path and try to find your own way.
6242:The path leads you to a lone island upon a sea of white sand.{}{}{}{}The island is small enough to hold only one tiny tree sapling, barely grown from the evergreen soil beneath its long silver roots. And yet, its presence is overwhelming as it tugs at the very fabric of your being.{}{}
6243:Approach it.
6244:Six stones lie before you, floating in the air. {}{}One is smooth and black with a single rune glowing on it.{}{}One is rough, uncut, woven in green vine.{}{}One is made of red ruby and shaped into a heart.{}{}One is square and seems to have rows of words written upon it.{}{}One is sharp, hot and red with blood.{}{}One is made of glass that reflects a single ray of sunlight, even here.{}{}{}{}You know each stone speaks to the divine domains, and you know approaching them will guide you to your deity.
6245:Choose Light and Turmoil for Svarog.
6246:Choose Harmony and Intellect for Lada.
6247:Choose Nature and Harmony for Dievanna.
6248:Choose Harmony and Light for Stribog.
6249:Choose Magic and Intellect for Marovit.
6250:Choose Magic and Turmoil for Zorya.
6251:Choose Magic and Nature for Horz.
6252:Choose Nature, Magic, and Intellect for Nyia. 
6253:Choose Turmoil, Nature, and Light for Triglav.
6254:You hear the thud of a hammer upon an anvil and feel the warmth of a forge surround you.{}{}{}{}'SO, YOU ARE MY CHOSEN, THEN?'{}{}
6255:Deny it. You did not choose this path!
6256:Confirm it. You have always felt you were made for something more!
6257:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, so was my thundering father, once upon a time...{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Forged in the fires of my divine will, you are marked to walk my path. {}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6258:Accept this calling.
6259:'Ha! I see an iron will and a defiant streak - direct even in the face of your god. Good, the fates have chosen well. {}{}{}{}Now, your foolishness aside...'
6260:Try to leave.
6261:You try to leave and your body burns to ash. You feel it scorching even as you turn to dust. {}{}{}{}Then you are lifted, moulded, and reforged. {}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6262:'The mark of fire is not for the cowardly!{}{}{}{}You must stand in defence of the weak. You must take action and fight against your foes.{}{}{}{}You must be my hammer, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6263:Ask for more information.
6264:Accept his bidding.
6265:You hear the voice of your god shift, as if they now spoke as all the gods together:{}{}{}{}'This is the sacred cosmic tree, our divine home and our blood duty. {}{}{}{}It holds darkness at bay, you see. The crown holds the dark skies where they should be. And while the dark lingers yet in our land, it is no longer all-devouring. {}{}{}{}And yet, the tree stands in peril once more. But more so, we all stand in despair.'{}{}
6266:Ask why the gods need a chosen.
6267:'The Shattering that split our land so long ago, we slowed it, but it grows, it lingers, and I fear that from the depths of the chasms comes a new danger.'
6268:Ask why the gods need you, then.
6269:Ask what danger.
6270:'The gods fight with forces beyond your reach or understanding, but I believe the real fight awaits below, with you. {}{}{}{}Marked by the pantheon, you and those who will join you will find the truth that is clouded from our divine sight.'
6271:Svarog's voice rings with doubt as he speaks:{}{}{}{}'It is something old, something hidden, something that beckons me to its grasp. My fires burn ever brighter, the sun grows stronger, and yet even I fear it...{}{}{}{}Our time here grows short. I know not what path you need to take, but I will guide your steps as you will guide my sight. Go. Live. Grow. But do not forget your purpose!'
6272:Kneel in acceptance.
6273:Nod defiantly.
6274:Ask what of the other gods, other chosen who you feel here with you.
6275:'Yes, good. Your heart burns with my iron will and you felt it always. {}{}{}{}Now you must be my hammer amongst the lands of the living.'
6276:'Yes, a true champion, willing to take up the mantle without fear. Forged you right, that I did. Good.'
6277:'For the cosmic tree felt the danger and so did our divine parents, Mokosh and Perun, and our eldest siblings, Morena and Veles. The four disappeared, and for a time the earth ceased to break. {}{}{}{}They also shielded the tree, but this has its own side effects.'
6278:Yes?
6279:'The tree is protected, but this protection takes strength from us directly, so we cannot give our full strength to our children.{}{}{}{}Once again, it is up to mortals and their allies to restore Thea.{}{}{}{}Marked by the pantheon, you and those who will join you will find the truth that is clouded from our divine sight.'
6280:'You will find signs, you will see the wrongs of this land. In time, your true purpose will become clear to you. {}{}{}{}Be well, my children!'
6281:Wake up.
6282:You walk away, try to wake, but nothing works. Eventually, the path leads you to a lone island upon a sea of white sand. {}{}{}{}The island is small enough to hold only one tiny tree sapling, barely grown from the evergreen soil beneath its long silver roots.
6283:You smell the sweetness of flowers and sense the warmth of a lover's embrace.{}{}{}{}'AH, YOU ARE MY CHOSEN?'{}{}
6284:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, so was my thundering father, once upon a time...{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of love and hope, ready to fight for them.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6285:'Yes, good. Your heart burns with my passion and you felt it always.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my herald of hope amongst the lands of the living.'
6286:'Oh my. I see. All this passion and a defiant streak - direct even in the face of your god. Good, the fates have chosen well. {}{}{}{}Now, your foolishness aside...'
6287:You try to leave and hear her whisper sweetly in your ear, and you no longer wish to go. After all, why would you ever want to leave the side of the most wonderful being in all creation?{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6288:'The mark of hope is not for the meek, as many may see it.{}{}{}{}You must stand in defence of the weak. You must take action and fight against your foes to shine the way for love to triumph.{}{}{}{}You must be my bearer, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6289:Accept their bidding.
6290:The voice of all gods speaks to you with sadness:{}{}{}{}'It is something old, something hidden, something that beckons me to its grasp. Fires burn ever brighter, the sun grows stronger, and yet it feels wrong.{}{}{}{}Our time here grows short. I know not what path you need to take, but I will guide your steps as you will guide my sight. Go. Live. Grow. But do not forget your purpose!'
6291:Nod defiantly.{}
6292:You smell freshness of the wild forest and sense the watchful eye of the huntress upon you.{}{}{}{}'SO YOU ARE MY CHOSEN?'{}{}
6293:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, so was our thundering father, once upon a time...{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of the wild, nature's child, destined to protect its laws.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6294:'Yes, good. You heard the call of the wild and answered even before knowing it was my voice calling. {}{}{}{}Now you must be my arrow amongst the lands of the living.'
6295:'The mark of the wild is not for everyone.{}{}{}{}You must stand in defence of nature in all its diversity, be it the beauty of the green world or the terror of her wrath. Balance is your calling.{}{}{}{}You must be my bearer, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6296:You see your body age before your very eyes. Within a few breaths, you approach death, die, decay, become worm food, then are reborn, remade. {}{}{}{}The cycle continues without end and the huntress just stands there, watching.{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6297:You smell seawater and feel the brisk touch of waves upon you. {}{}{}{}'YOU, MY CHOSEN!'{}{}
6298:'Yes, good. As patron of travellers and master of the winds and seas, I would not like to think my own champion lost or confused.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my herald amongst the lands of the living.'
6299:'The mark of the wind is wrought with challenge. {}{}{}{}You must try to be the compass by which others find their path, seek balance and peace, but defend them too when needs be.{}{}{}{}You must be my bearer, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6300:You find yourself dazzled by an array of colours and sensations that you recognise as the weaves of magic.{}{}{}{}'AH, MY CHOSEN, YES?'{}{}
6301:'Yes, good. You have always felt the oddity of your nature, the mystical weaves that guide your path. Yes.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my catalyst amongst the lands of the living.'
6302:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, so was our thundering father, once upon a time...{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of the chaos, driven by mystery.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6303:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, so was our thundering father, once upon a time...{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Blown by winds of chance into my service, or perhaps born into it?{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6304:You try to leave, but with every step the wind brings you the song of death and destruction, the pleas of many lives all laid on your shoulders until the weight is too much to bear...{}{}{}{}Then you are lifted, and within the embrace of the wind, you feel free and right.{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6305:'One voice speaks to you today, but all divine eye are upon you, Chosen. All of you who listened today are marked and WATCHED by their divine guardians.{}{}{}{}The cosmic pantheon has many voices, but we are all one, lest we are all gone.'
6306:'The mark of the mystical is ever dark and twisted.{}{}{}{}You must try to remain uncorrupted while you delve into the worlds so inhuman. Even if you are no mystic yourself, our link will forever tug at your soul.{}{}{}{}You must be my catalyst, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6307:You try to leave and feel your very soul assailed by eternal darkness twisting and changing you, corrupting your very being until you become naught but an angry wraith.{}{}{}{}Then, slowly, you are returned to your form, with only a nasty aftertaste in your mouth.{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6308:You hear the clutter of blades clashing, and you are blinded by three stars appearing before you.{}{}{}{}'MY CHOSEN!'{}{}
6309:'You will find signs, you will see the wrongs of this land. In time, your true purpose will become clear to you. {}{}{}{}Be well, our children!'
6310:'Yes, good! You felt the call of the beast, felt your blood rushing into combat, even as you sleep. Yes!{}{}{}{}Now you must be my sharpened spear amongst the lands of the living.' 
6311:'A reluctant servant -- how dare you! Bah, perhaps it is best, for those who are too eager often disappoint... or perhaps I will just eat your heart, that works too.{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of the stars, destined to fight with honour.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6312:You try to leave and your body burns to white ash, the blazing cold light of the stars piercing your whole being.{}{}{}{}Then you are lifted, moulded, and reborn. {}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6313:'The mark of the stars is not for cowards!{}{}{}{}You must stand strong in the face of any enemy, and you must kill them with honour, or die trying.{}{}{}{}You must be my blade, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion.'
6314:You smell the undeniable stench of rotting flesh, and you sense the sorrows of passing souls before you.{}{}{}{}'CHOSEN, but by whom, I wonder? ME?'{}{}
6315:'Oh, I see. How odd. I never did feel your coming until just now, or did I?{}{}{}{}Yet you felt our bond -- good, useful, wise.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my minion amongst the lands of the living.'
6316:'Yes, I can certainly sympathise, for I too have no recollection of our bonding. Yet a bond there exists, and we both must serve it.{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Cursed follow my path of death, scorned by others, yet needed.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6317:You try to leave, but with every step you sense the presence of the goddess upon you. Her silent lips whispering, her empty eyes watching. A sense of dread and futility overwhelms you.{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'Death is the only certainty -- or is it? Still, we must proceed.'
6318:'The mark of the dead is an unpleasant burden.{}{}{}{}You must respect the laws of nature and guide souls to their end. If it were up to me, this would be all, but they say we must also help the living, aid the other gods. Do so, in my name.{}{}{}{}You must be my hand, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion -- and others seem to think this will not be good.'{}{}
6319:You smell molten lava and taste ash on your teeth. You feel rage fill you up and hear the roar of many warriors.{}{}{}{}'CHOSEN!'{}{}
6320:'Yes, good! You are no misguided weakling, you KNOW! You were born to serve my might. This is good.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my axe amongst the lands of the living.'
6321:'What? A coward, a naysayer, a meek mouse born of my lava? NO! YOU WILL OBEY!{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of the molten rock, bred for one purpose only.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6322:Your body is torn into pieces, burnt, devoured by some mystical force. Then a soothing touch returns you to life, but even that hand of life feels stern and unyielding in its design for you.{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY!'
6323:'The mark of the three is not for cowards!{}{}{}{}You were called to heed my fury, feed my fires, and do my bidding. If you fail, all shall burn!{}{}{}{}You must be my weapon, for the land will soon shatter into oblivion -- and only I can decide if such fate is to be!'
6324:You smell fresh blood and the brisk touch of midnight air. You hear the howling of many wolves, and instinctively, you join them, until a single clear voice answers your call.{}{}{}{}'I hear your call, CHOSEN!'{}{}
6325:'Yes, good. You have always felt the call of the moon, even if you are no night beast. You are a moonchild, no less.{}{}{}{}Now you must be my beta amongst the lands of the living.'
6326:'A reluctant hero, then. Very well. After all, my own mate is the unruly daughter of the sun, and she too never admits her duties freely!{}{}{}{}Be it by design, choice, or pure fate, you are mine. Born of the night and moon, destined to walk the dark path yet fight for light.{}{}{}{}And if you shall fall, another will take your place, until there are no faithful to call upon.'{}{}
6327:You try to leave, but this is a dream, so your path winds in circles. A large wolf sits and watches you patiently -- laughing?{}{}{}{}You stand before the tree sapling again.{}{}{}{}'READY?'
6328:'The mark of the night lord is dark and never easy.{}{}{}{}You must honour the call of the moon and the night, but never give in to darkness completely, for your pack is of the cosmic tree.{}{}{}{}Heed my howl, heel to my will, and thus be free and wild!'
6329:'DIRECT, GOOD.' {}{}{}{}You are chosen, you WILL do as the gods will it and soon, once you are settled, a mission of great importance will become clear to you.{}{}
6330:Nod and wake up.
6331:As the sun rises high, you feel its gentle warmth on your skin and rejoice at the growing strength of the light over darkness.{}{}{}{}But as you do so, you begin to feel uneasy. The warmth becomes ever more constant, unrelenting. The air stale and oppressive.
6332:[Light or Harmony]Focus on your domain and try to find out what is happening here.
6333:[Intellect or Nature]The unusual is the norm in Thea, and thus one must not panic. Try to move away calmly.
6334:[Turmoil or Magic]This light is burning you alive! Try to find the source so you can defeat it.
6335:As you observe the world around you, you soon see that the sun's rays are full of odd creatures. These light wisps are trying to attach themselves to you with their tentacles, and you sense their attempt to burn through your body and spirit. {}{}{}{}Your domain shields you somewhat, but then, you also feel the call of this warmth, so sweet and promising. 
6336:Resist physically and move away.
6337:Use the connection to your domain and resist spiritually.
6338:Your will shall not be broken. Your mind will repel these fiends.
6339:You remain strong, and the creatures' attempts are futile. Seeing their failure, the wisps flicker away towards the sun and disappear. {}{}{}{}You see burnt carcasses of bugs and small critters around you, but you also spot a small pack of oddly paired beings moving away in unison, as if trying to follow the wisps.
6340:The call of the light proves too strong to resist. For a moment, you let go, you open yourself to the burning warmth and accept the will of the overbearing brightness that calls for you to become one, to let go, to just be...{}{}{}{}You manage to break free, but you feel exhausted, and some of your weaker companions may not be so lucky.
6341:As you brace yourself against the heat, you soon see that the sun's rays are full of odd creatures. These light wisps are trying to attach themselves to you with their tentacles, and they are burning through your body and spirit. {}{}{}{}The darkness that accompanies turmoil and magic is weak against this foe, but if you resist, your dark power can destroy them.
6342:[Turmoil]Resist physically and try to destroy them!
6343:[Magic]Use the connection to your domain and resist spiritually.
6344:The force of the light proves too strong to resist. For a moment, you feel that your very connection to the gods is being assailed with burning ferocity that seeks to extinguish all remnants of darkness with no regard for the host's life.{}{}{}{}You manage to break free, but you feel your soul marked by this experience.
6345:You resist the assault, and your domain exudes a burst of darkness that destroys these infernal beings and turns them into obsidian ash.{}{}{}{}You do not know what they were, but their power was unnatural and potent enough to reach your divine connection.
6346:As you slowly move away, you soon see that the sun's rays are full of odd creatures. These light wisps are trying to attach themselves to you with their tentacles, and they are burning through your body and spirit. {}{}{}{}Your domain remains neutral to this assault, which allows you greater clarity of mind to resist the attack.
6347:You remain strong and balanced, committed to neither light nor darkness in your domain, so the wisps seem unable to reach you. Seeing their failure, the wisps flicker away towards the sun and disappear. {}{}{}{}You see burnt carcasses of bugs and small critters around you, but you also spot a small pack of oddly paired beings moving away in unison, as if trying to follow the wisps.
6348:The force of the light proves too strong to resist. For a moment, you feel the wisps burning through your body, soul, and mind, seeking to cleanse you, to make you one with the light.{}{}{}{}You manage to break free, and the clarity of your natural domain keeps you mostly unscathed.
6349:As you recover from yet another nasty tremor and look around in the debris for useful resources, you spot an odd-looking man sitting behind a table, surrounded by all sorts of strange contraptions, scrolls, vials, and tools.
6350:Go speak to him.
6351:You charge the lone man and topple him without any trouble. He seems bewildered and looks around as if expecting help. He mumbles:{}{}{}{}'Damned mercs, one tremor and they run off... What... I mean, how can I help you?'
6352:Ask him what he is doing here.
6353:You approach the man and he looks up at you, puzzled, then looks around for a bit and mumbles:{}{}{}{}'Damned mercs, one tremor and they run off... What... I mean, how can I help you?'
6354:Ask what he is doing here, in the aftermath of a tremor, with all this equipment.
6355:Enquire who he is.
6356:'Ah, well. I am measuring the tremors - the strength, how long they last, the frequency with which they occur. Trying to pinpoint the epicentre, you see.'
6357:Ask for the shortest possible account of what is happening here. [SKIP STORY]
6358:'Like finding patient zero, I suppose - that is, a person who fell ill first, or in this case, a place, perhaps. That is the thing that began the disaster, be it disease, curse, act of the gods - they all tend to have a beginning. Like the burning of the cosmic tree that brought about the darkness centuries ago, yes?'
6359:Ask about the darkness and the burning of this tree.
6360:Ask if he found his patient zero.
6361:'I am the Alchemist - or so they call me. In truth, alchemy is but one of my many talents. A renaissance scholar, that's what I am!'
6362:What's a renaissance? 
6363:Ask for the shortest possible account of what is happening here. 
6364:'Oh, ah. Never mind, it's a thing from my dreams... {}{}{}{}I am a learned man. In the days before the dark, we were aplenty, but these days we are few. For our part in the whole darkness disaster, it has become somewhat of an unpopular career choice.'
6365:'I am looking for the beginning of it all, the catalyst, or the culprit, whatever I find. {}{}{}{}And I am close. But I need to take measurements from within a cave, and it seems occupied by bandits - a large cohort, uninterested in the fate of the world, you see.'
6366:Ask what needs to be done.
6367:'I am close. But I need to take measurements from within a cave, and it seems occupied by bandits - a large cohort, uninterested in the fate of the world, you see.'
6368:Ask if he knows how to get in.
6369:'Ah, well, the not-so-reputable history of my profession. The long and short of it is that scholars meddled with the ways of the gods, thought to rid us all of magic - bring about an age of reason. Only they didn't account for the gods having an actual world-saving job.'
6370:'The cosmic tree, you see, is the core that makes our Slavyan gods divine. Its roots hold the key to the underworlds, the trunk gives connection to the mortal realms, and the crown, well, that keeps the darkness in check. The tree burnt, the age of darkness consumed us, until the Awakening.'
6371:The Awakening?
6372:'Brave champions of the gods restored the tree and thus gave divine power back to the pantheon. Or at least that's the official line. There were rumours of other paths, tales of the tree being reborn despite those faithful failing their task, attempts to keep the dark going, all sorts. And there is talk of gods fighting, disappearing. I do not know more. It is not my area of expertise.'
6373:Ask why then he is investigating the tremors. Is it to do with the tree again?
6374:So if the tree is safe now, why are we having problems? Darkness isn't gone -- it still lurks in places, and now the noon light burns so bright and the shakes destroy so much.
6375:'No, not directly, I would imagine. But something shattered the earth, and while we survived, the shaking is getting more frequent. I fear we may yet face extinction if we do nothing.'
6376:Enquire if he plans to stop it himself.
6377:'Me? Oh, gods no. You will. Or won't. That will be your choice once more, I suppose, as the wheel must turn. {}{}{}{}I am merely taking measurements, looking for clues and happy to share them.'
6378:Why does he say that about you?
6379:'I am a learned man, I just know these things...'
6380:Demand a true answer!
6381:Nod and ask if he has any real clues, then.
6382:He goes quiet for a time, murmurs something under his breath, then replies:{}{}{}{}'I am a scholar, yes, but no stranger to the ways of fate. I see many things, and many are so confusing - past, present, future. Possibilities spilling over and over. {}{}{}{}And I saw you come to me, and I see you as you are, chosen or what have you -- not merely by your gods, for with those I squabble a lot, but by fate. Now enough of my ramblings, no?'
6383:'Well, the way I see it, there are a few ways to deal with it. One, try to parley with the lot - an awful idea, if you ask me, but who knows. Second's obvious, but not my cup of tea - brute force. And then there's always other ways. Like I heard the scavengers who live nearby hate the bandits - a feud amongst rabble, heh. Perhaps use that?'
6384:So you need to get rid of the bandits from the cave, or convince them to let him set up camp? 
6385:'Yes, your grasp of the finer details is impressive. I should also say I tried asking them. Got myself robbed, beaten, and barely escaped with my life. Just so you know the sort you're dealing with, if you choose to help, that is.'
6386:Say you will look into it if you can.
6387:You take a swing at him, but he shields himself with a large book, then drops a glass vial on the floor, releasing a toxic cloud that blinds you for a few seconds. {}{}{}{}A group of mercenaries appears by his side and he shouts: 'Finally! What do I pay you for?'{}{}{}{}They charge at you.
6388:The mercs are dead, and the odd man tries to run but you catch him. He squeals at your feet:{}{}{}{}'Gah, so much blood, you'd think I'd be okay with blood by now... So, can we perhaps talk about this? I am trying to save the world and all...'
6389:Listen to him.
6390:'I am looking for the beginning of it all - the Shattering, I mean. I am looking for answers because we're out of time.{}{}{}{}And I am close. But I need to take measurements within a cave, and it seems occupied by bandits - a large cohort, uninterested in the fate of the world, you see.'
6391:You kill the man and loot his strange table. Among other things, you find a map with a place distinctly marked: 'Stupid bandits unable to grasp the importance of their cave - need to get in here before all shatters!'
6392:'The giants, ah, yes. There is speculation that the two are related, but in what way, I do not know. Giants did return, but they were put back to sleep, else we'd see them roaming our land still. It's not like they were stealthy about it. {}{}{}{}So some other connection must be hidden from us.'
6393:'Ah, the right question, precisely. Why indeed? The tree is saved, but it is clearly weakened again - perhaps threatened by the Shattering? Gods that once were have disappeared, and others have come to be. And all are trying to learn why this is happening. I suspected giants, of course, but I don't know...'
6394:Giants?
6395:The mercenaries beat you badly, and the man you tried to kill speaks:{}{}{}{}'I am called the Alchemist, a scholar of sorts. I've been waiting for you, though I admit I was hoping for less turmoil. Still. Are we good to have a conversation now?'
6396:'Fine, fine, a monologue, then, while I have your undivided attention. {}{}{}{}I am looking for the beginning of it all, the catalyst, or the culprit, whatever I find. {}{}{}{}And I am close. But I need to take measurements within a cave, and it seems occupied by bandits - a large cohort, uninterested in the fate of the world, you see.'
6397:The mercenaries continue to point weapons at you. Keep listening.
6398:'And so, in short, I'll mark the location of said bandits for you, and if you choose to do the world-saving thing, please get them to let me into the red cave. Now, off I go, and try not to die before you serve a purpose - I mean, those aren't even expensive mercenaries...'{}{}{}{}He leaves with his men.
6399:You come to a mound that looks like a red blemish unnaturally formed from a strange reddish clay. There is a tear in the middle and beyond it you know lies the red-ridger camp.
6400:Go in closer. 
6401:Just like the Alchemist said, the camp is well situated to repel any attacks, with plenty of natural cover and good line of sight. {}{}{}{}You are not able to spot much from a safe distance, but you see regular patrols of fairly well-armed folk.
6402:Spend more time observing them, then attack!
6403:Approach them to talk.
6404:As you walk towards the camp, you sense that you are being watched. A small group of ruffians meets you at the edge of the camp. One of the men, a burly-looking human, speaks:{}{}{}{}'It isn't often that folk hand themselves to us, so I'll assume you have business here?'
6405:[Strength]Make sure they see your strength, then answer that you wish to gain access to the cave in the red mound.
6406:[Attractive]Smile and say that you wish only to visit a cave in the red mound.
6407:[Bandit]Say that you aren't here to piss on their turf, only to go into the red cave.
6408:Nod and tell them you need to see the cave in the red mound. 
6409:'You with that oddball bookworm type? We told him and we'll tell you - that cave is our turf, no stragglers, no sightseein'.'
6410:Try to haggle with them. Surely there is a price they would accept for entry?
6411:'You speak some sense. No reason to pass on an opportunity when it comes a'knockin'. I tell ya what, there's an old witch hut not too far from here -- a baba yaga, we think, lives there. The cursed thing's been interfering with business and we ain't no spirit folk to deal with such sort. {}{}{}{}Deal with her, and we may let you peek into our cave.{}{}{}{}Or there's another task you can do.'
6412:'I suppose if you go and slaughter those filthy scavengers down by the lake, yeah, that'll be a treat, then we'll let you snoop in the cave all you like.{}{}{}{}I'll mark both on your maps, and you decide which favour you'll do.'
6413:'Bah, you bore me to death with your word vomit. Just shut your gob. {}{}{}{}I'd kick your butts and be done with it, but we do have us two problems we'd like dealt with, and I ain't gonna cry if you die trying to do them for us.'
6414:'There's an old gold mine, swarming with some demon kind. We don't like meddling with their sort. Get us the mine and we'll talk about the cave.{}{}{}{}Or there's another constant sore up our butts you can help with...'
6415:'Go and slaughter those filthy scavengers down by the lake, yeah, that'll be a treat, then we'll let you snoop in the cave all you like.{}{}{}{}I'll mark both on your maps, and you decide which favour you'll do.'
6416:'Suppose you look impressive-like, yeah. So we can talk. But, you with that oddball bookworm type? We told him and we'll tell you - that cave is our turf, no stragglers, no sightseein'.'
6417:You slaughter most of the bandits. Those who survive run away via hidden passages, swearing revenge upon you.{}{}{}{}You find some goods, and even some cages where livestock and people were held. Some are empty, but perhaps a few may yet be occupied.
6418:You find a horse, some dogs, and several bodies of scavengers, including children, although some may yet be alive.
6419:Gather what you can and help the wounded.
6420:The Alchemist arrives out of nowhere and looks pleased, ignoring all the bloody carnage and his own ghostly form:{}{}{}{}'Splendid! My oh my, I never did think you'd go this way. {}{}{}{}So, the cave entrance is now clear. I will go in first, make way and mark it for you on the map. Come join me if you want to find out more about the Shattering.'
6421:But you killed him?
6422:The bandits beat you badly and force you to flee, taking some of your belongings!{}{}
6423:As you escape, the Alchemist's ghost approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Yes, it is me, although somewhat changed. And yes, I've been following you. Fat chance of getting in the cave that way now. Here, there's a scavenger camp not too far, and they hate the red-ridge bandits. Perhaps you can get revenge and find me a way in still?'
6424:'You again! Die!'{}{}
6425:'So you done the deed? No? Bugger off, then. Go do what we asked.'
6426:Ask about the witch's story.
6427:Talk to them about the demons and their side of the story.
6428:Yes, tell them you have been to the places they sent you.
6429:Call upon the demons for aid and attack the bandits!
6430:'So you done the deed??
6431:Question the bandits about kidnapping scavenger kids.
6432:[Lie]Yes, killed the scavengers.
6433:Yes, killed the scavengers.
6434:[Lie]Yes, the mine is theirs.
6435:Yes, the mine is theirs.
6436:[Lie]Yes, the baba yaga is dead.
6437:Yes, the baba yaga is dead.
6438:'So, demon tells you a sob story and you come askin' us if we're the evil type? Sure, whatever. Those buggers become worse than pests. Coming to bother us like crazy, they the ones who broke laws first, we just try to keep us lot safe, and prosperous too, sure.'
6439:Ask for more details. How did the demons become crazy? 
6440:Nod and agree that demons should be dealt with. Leave to do your task.
6441:Go back to the demons. They mentioned a way to try to kill those bandits.
6442:'All done, eh? That easy, was it? You don't look too beat up for it.'
6443:Convince them you dealt with it.
6444:[Attractive]Say that your pretty face would never lie.
6445:'Beats me, but they started to act out of sorts. House demons swarming our camp and fighting for favour, then turning nasty on each other and us. Those damned tooth-fairy types, pulling our teeth out at night! Karakandza tunnelling beneath us like crazy, searchin' for the tree, they said. Bah, madness. We had to start controlling the lot.'
6446:Say you will deal with the problem as promised.
6447:'Everyone's got their tall tale, eh? Some crazy chick told ya we're the cause of all her bad days. Sure, likely we are. Just see how those kids that stay with them filthy scavengers do, will ya? Yeah, didn't think you'd bother. Whatever. We do take them young ones - we keep some, we sell some, we lose some, that's life.'
6448:Nod, agree this is none of your business, and go back to killing witches.
6449:[Lie]Actually, the baba yaga is dead.
6450:You speak the power word and know that a karakandza will aid you in this fight. 
6451:'Excellent. Now, we said we'd consider letting you in the cave if you did the job, so I'm considering...'
6452:Nod and say you did as you were asked, and all you need is entry to the cave.
6453:Tell him he'd better keep his end of the deal!
6454:'Bah, you did well.{}{}{}{}Go in, look around the cave to your heart's desire. We ain't gonna bother you or your odd friend.'
6455:Thank him and go inform the Alchemist.
6456:'You did well. {}{}{}{}But as I said, we'll consider it. So pay us a good price and we have us a deal.'
6457:[Beauty]Convince the captain you can make this worth his while.
6458:'Deal. Go in, look around the cave to your heart's desire. We ain't gonna bother you or your odd friend.'
6459:Thank him and say you'll check it out.
6460:'Oh, ah. Well, if you put it that way...{}{}{}{}Deal. Go in, look around the cave to your heart's desire. We ain't gonna bother you or your odd friend.{}{}{}{}And we can go seal the deal, eh?'
6461:Nod and go make the captain happy.
6462:Refuse, say you changed your mind after all.
6463:'You lying scum, die!'
6464:'Ha! Ha, I say. You've gone and done what I've been trying for a long while. Gods be damned, you're good, you are!{}{}{}{}Go in, look around the cave to your heart's desire. We ain't gonna bother you or your odd friend. Who knows, you might have made us into honest folk yet. Now that we don't have so many scoundrels about, we may settle. Gods be good to you, friend.'
6465:Bear keeps eying you, looking very pleased. He seems to want to follow you. Ask him?
6466:'Yeah, you got me there, you did. I mean, I've been trying to follow the gods, but my band here, they're just not god-fearing enough...{}{}{}{}Say, my son is ready to do some banditry out of my shadow. What say you to me coming along with you for a while?'
6467:Agree. Thank him and go inform the Alchemist.
6468:'The rod of the old mother, I see. Yes, so they're gone, finally. {}{}{}{}We will of course go and confirm. I am reluctant to trust strangers, but let us drink tonight!'
6469:Use the opportunity of drinking to try to steal away the kidnapped children.
6470:Put some poison in their drink, then attack whoever is left.
6471:Use the element of surprise and attack!
6472:Try to play along with the lie. Perhaps they will not notice the scavengers aren't dead.
6473:The poison works well. You slaughter the bandits and those who survive run away via hidden passages, swearing revenge upon you.{}{}{}{}You find some goods, and even some cages where livestock and people were held. Some are empty, but perhaps a few may yet be occupied.
6474:You sneak in and manage to rescue the scavenger child, along with a few others. {}{}{}{}They are unusually reluctant to be rescued, so they make a real ruckus and you are forced to run fast before the bandits catch you. There's little chance of them being friendly now.
6475:'That again. Sure, we get us some prisoners from time to time.'
6476:Why keep prisoners?
6477:[Lie]We killed the scavengers.
6478:Ask if you can buy one prisoner, the scavenger child. You did do the bandits a favour already, after all.
6479:'Bah, you and your nosy questions. I guess sometimes we are. Not as a rule, but if we have too many rascals, we do exchange them, sure. Whatever's good for business.'{}{}
6480:No. Say you will come back when the deed is done. Leave.
6481:[Lie]Actually, we killed the scavengers already.
6482:'What ya mean, why? Why do ya ever have prisoners? 'Cause they're not us and they ain't dead. {}{}{}{}Some will die 'cause they're sickly bastards, we hope. Some we sell or somethin', dunno, we will decide.'
6483:Even the children?
6484:'S'far as I care, little ones are gonna be big one day. {}{}{}{}But we'll have them looked at, healed maybe. Re-homed, or sometimes kept. Depends on the rascal. Some will die like the others, or make us rich, sure.'
6485:So they are slavers too?
6486:'Heh, sure, why not. Though it's a bad deed you're doing, giving them to those bastards again...'{}{}
6487:'Did ya meet them? Garbage sort - wild, scary types. Eat human flesh, even, that's why the gods don't like 'em and all. But you did us a solid, so we'll sell you the brat.'
6488:Buy the child.
6489:Change your mind. Tell them you'll deal with the scavengers after all.
6490:The Alchemist arrives out of nowhere and looks pleased, ignoring all the bloody carnage:{}{}{}{}'Splendid! My oh my, I never did think you'd go this way. {}{}{}{}So the cave entrance is now clear. I will go in first, make way and mark it for you on the map. Come join me if you want to find out more about the Shattering.'
6491:Say that you will join him when you can. 
6492:'Oh, that. Well, yes, let's not reminisce. Time's a wasting, worlds need saving. Off we go, water under the bridge and all that.'{}{}{}{}He rushes off.
6493:As you leave, the Alchemist approaches you on the road:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes, I am alive. Let's not bother with details, bygones be bygones. Well done, I shall meet you at the cave.'{}{}{}{}He departs.
6494:As you escape, the Alchemist approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Oh my, you went in with a hammer, didn't you... hmm. Fat chance of getting in that way.{}{}{}{}Here, there's a scavenger camp not too far. They hate the red-ridge bandits. Perhaps you can get revenge and find me a way in still?'
6495:You fail and the bandits uncover your intent.{}{}{}{}They beat you badly, take all your stuff, and chase you away!{}{}
6496:You begin to parley, and they promise to let you into the cave, until someone reports that the scavengers are just fine.{}{}{}{}They beat you badly, take all your stuff, and chase you away. No chance for parley now.{}{}
6497:'Suppose you're one of us, or ya were once, so we can talk. But, you with that oddball bookworm type? We told him and we'll tell you - that cave is our turf, no stragglers, no sightseein'.'
6498:The bandits have clearly heard of your deals with the scavengers...{}{}{}{}'You again! Die!'
6499:The bandits beat you badly and force you to flee, taking some of your belongings!{}{}{}{}Your only option now is to find a way to come back and defeat them.{}{}
6500:You find the witch hut the bandits spoke of. It looks typically odd and crooked, but you also see it is in bad shape.
6501:[Witch]A baba yaga does not dwell here, but a fellow witch may. If she does, she isn't very strong, as she can't keep up the illusions of the hut. Call out to the witch.
6502:[Magic users]Take a closer look, something seems off here.
6503:Whatever this is, charge in and attack!
6504:You hear a lot of rustling in the hut and sense a rise of some force, but much more primal than what your sisters can typically use. You hear a croaking voice:{}{}{}{}'Ha, sister, yes. Well, leave. This is my house and I have no time for... tea, no.'
6505:[Demon]This all feels familiar. Call upon a fake witch law that would compel her to let you in.
6506:Convince her to let you in, time or no time. Witches should stick together in these hard times.
6507:How rude, attack!
6508:This type of witch's hut needs strong magic to keep it 'alive,' and whoever occupies this one either doesn't have it or doesn't know how to use it. {}{}{}{}It is very rare to find a witch hut that isn't fully controlled by its witch, so this is an opportunity.
6509:Call out to whoever resides here. Tell them you've come prepared so not to try any magic tricks on you.
6510:Try to control this house yourself!
6511:'Oh, a law, you say, well. Hmm. Okay, come in...'
6512:You enter the house and see it is cluttered to the brim with odd bits, broken glass, bits of jewellery, scraps of clothes, and all sorts of things. {}{}{}{}There are also rows of beads hanging from the ceiling, and they are made of teeth.{}{}{}{}A young woman, far too cheerful for a sister of yours, stands in a corner.
6513:Call her out on the lie. Say there is no witch law, and only a fellow demon would believe there was one.
6514:She mumbles something about stupid demons, then speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Yeah, I said so, but they said I am not witch enough to know and laws must be obeyed, stupid little buggers. Come out and face the music!'{}{}{}{}Several small green creatures fly out from her backpack.
6515:Tooth thieves, an odd type of forest folk that dabbles in house demon business, specifically taking teeth for favours. Ask what they're all doing here, and why the bandits sent you here as if they were a menace.
6516:Do what you came here for, attack!
6517:'Oh, fine. If you must know, I'll tell you why I'm here.'
6518:Yes, but just tell the short story. [SKIP STORY]
6519:'I was one of the kids those bandits kidnapped from scavenger camps. I got away, got lost in a forest. The fairy folk helped me, brought me up, taught me magic. The bandits also killed their folk, you see, they used to live by the red cave. {}{}{}{}We found this house. It has lots of magic. I found a way to pester those bastards. Boils, itchy feet, vomiting, someday maybe more. And when they tried to come here, we even killed some.'
6520:Convince them you don't care about the revenge angle. You just need to go into the red cave, so they need to leave, for good. 
6521:Say that you understand, and leave them be. 
6522:This house could be valuable, and the witch isn't being careful now that she's talking to you. Use this opportunity to kill her and her demon friends!
6523:'I was one of the kids those bandits kidnapped from scavenger camps. I got away, got lost in a forest. The fairy folk helped me, brought me up, taught me magic, even -- or as much as they could teach a scavenger brat.'
6524:Ask why they did that.
6525:'The bandits also killed their folk, you see. They used to live by the red cave. In fact, those thugs are relentless fairy hunters. They catch them and lock them in cages and sell them off as pets!'
6526:But how did they find a way to threaten a camp that strong? 
6527:'We found this house. It is old, full of magic. Together, we found ways to use it, demon tricks and witch spells. We cause them boils, itchy feet, vomiting, and when they tried to come here, well, that's when the real fun started. We got a few of them in the pot, didn't we, boys?'{}{}{}{}The fairies nod and snicker with the witch, and you notice a big pot full of meat stew.
6528:Say that you need to consider your options.
6529:You enter the house and see it is cluttered to the brim with odd bits, broken glass, bits of jewellery, scraps of clothes, and all sorts of things. {}{}{}{}There are also rows of beads hanging from the ceiling, and they are made of teeth.{}{}{}{}A young woman, far too cheerful for a witch, stands in a corner. While you sense she has some skill with the mystical arts, you do not think she is a proper witch.
6530:Call her out on the lie.
6531:Take another look at this house, as you feel strong magic emanating from it, but it doesn't seem connected to the young woman.
6532:She looks nervous, and you sense the house becoming more hostile:{}{}{}{}'I... I am a witch, you know. Even scavengers can be one! And this is my house, and me and my friends own it, so go away!'{}{}{}{}You spot several green flying fairies with mean-looking teeth grinning at you.
6533:Tell her she must be honest with you, now!
6534:Since she is a witch and working with demons, attack her with spirit to give her a taste of the real thing!
6535:'No! Leave, or share the fate of the brutes who sent you here!'{}{}{}{}The house shifts and shakes, and you feel it becoming very hostile towards you.
6536:'I tell you what, you seem like the good sort. You say you serve the gods and I ain't convinced about that, but I do know those buggers down there won't care two bits.{}{}{}{}So if the world needs savin', me and the boys will stay quiet-like for two weeks, make them lot think we're gone. It'll be more fun that way anyhow. Deal?'
6537:Say that there is too much at stake. You need them really gone.
6538:This is wasting time, attack!
6539:'Sorry, best offer. Take it or leave it.'
6540:'Great, good luck savin' the world and all.'
6541:'Hmm, good. Maybe you can go and beat the shit out of them, eh? But listen, since you're so good, we're gonna stay low for some time. You can lie to them, tell them you killed us or whatnot, maybe jump their arses then, or just go to your cave. {}{}{}{}In any case, good luck with the world savin'.'
6542:[Witch]Perform a ritual to take charge of this witch's hut. Without it, whoever is inside likely has little power.
6543:Call out to the pretend witch and tell her you see through her lies.
6544:You charge in to attack, but before you reach the woman, the house shifts and shakes and you feel dizzy. Everything becomes blurry and you are attacked in the spirit world!
6545:Resist this attack!
6546:You manage to take control of the house. It is old and dying. There isn't much left, but you can drain it to gain power. {}{}{}{}A girl runs out, surrounded by several green flying creatures, some of whom seem wounded, as if it was them who held the house before:{}{}{}{}'You hurt them, you hurt them, how could you!'
6547:Tell her to calm down before you do the same to her.
6548:Kill her and the remaining creatures. 
6549:'I may not be strong, but I curse you!'{}{}{}{}She cries out and runs away, and the green creatures follow suit. You perform the final ritual to deplete the house and you feel some energy released into you. {}{}{}{}All that is left now is an old shack.
6550:You kill her and the creatures. You perform the final ritual to deplete the house and you feel some energy released into you. {}{}{}{}All that is left now is an old shack.
6551:You enter the house and see it is cluttered to the brim with odd bits, broken glass, bits of jewellery, scraps of clothes, and all sorts of things.{}{}{}{}There are also rows of beads hanging from the ceiling, and they are made of teeth. A young woman dressed in odd clothes and wearing a backpack full of junk stands in the corner and stares at you.{}{}{}{}'You better have a good excuse to poke your heads into my house, eh?'
6552:Intimidate her into leaving this place. Say that the bandits are set on burning her alive, and they have an even more powerful witch to help them.
6553:Try to appeal to her better nature. Explain that you need to get to the red cave, and for that to happen, she needs to leave the bandits alone.
6554:She spits at the ground:{}{}{}{}'Those buggers, I knew they'd come for me good one day! Thanks for the heads up, whoever you are. I may hate them lot, but I ain't sticking around to get dead. Here, my reward for you.'{}{}
6555:Wait for her to leave, then pilfer the house and leave.
6556:Ask why she hates the bandits so.
6557:Nod and wait for her to leave.
6558:You break away from the assault and run out of the house. Your spirit is weakened, and you suspect that further attempts will end in spiritual combat as well.
6559:The witch is slain, and the house slowly collapses on itself as if it was connected to the woman.
6560:Leave to inform the bandits.
6561:You fail. The house shifts and shakes and you feel it becoming very hostile towards you.
6562:'Yes, yes, I will leave forever.'
6563:Tell her how to heal and watch her leave.
6564:You kill the witch, but one of her demon friends curses you for it.
6565:The witch runs away, but you also see one small demon who survived. {}{}{}{}It smiles at you and bows, impressed with your mercy.
6566:You defeat the young witch and she cries out in pain as her spirit is depleted.{}{}{}{}'No, no, you took it away, no...'{}{}{}{}You know that her spirit can heal eventually, but she doesn't seem to know it.
6567:Tell her you will give her the secret to restoring her spirit if she swears to leave here forever.
6568:The house is hostile and tries to lure you into a spiritual fight as you approach. Any attempts to fight it by force end in you waving your weapons in thin air.
6569:'Sure, we'll give you time.'
6570:'You're back -- nice. Made a decision yet? {}{}{}{}So if the world needs savin', me and the boys will stay quiet-like for two weeks, make them lot think we're gone. It'll be more fun that way anyhow. Deal?' 
6571:As you approach, you see the house ready for travel. The witch pokes her head out of the window and waves at you:{}{}{}{}'Ha! You did it, well done. Here, catch, a thank-you gift. I am off to a new life now that my enemies are gone. I need to find new ways to entertain myself.'
6572:Wish her well and depart.
6573:'So they beat ya, eh? Guess your only chance at world saving's killing them lot. Here, drink this, should help a wee bit. {}{}{}{}I am off, gonna hide for a bit, don't like it when they're agitated. But good luck to ya!'
6574:'You seem a know-it-all. I ain't tellin' you nothin' more.'
6575:Convince them to talk with you.
6576:You approach the house, but it feels dead and it is empty.
6577:You find the entrance to the old gold mine, and from the bright light beaming out at you, you'd guess it is not unoccupied.
6578:Take a closer look first.
6579:You enter the tunnel and realise immediately that you are being watched. {}{}{}{}As you move forwards, you see gold ore that shouldn't glimmer but it does, as if it were purified and smelted already. You cannot yet see the light source that could cause such an effect. 
6580:[Demon]The bandits said demons guard this place. Speak up and appeal to your kinship.
6581:[Magic user]Focus your mind and soul on this place. Try to sense the source of the unnatural light.
6582:Proceed with caution and weapons drawn.
6583:[Dwarf]Touch this gold ore. There's something very wrong with it, and you know nothing if you don't know your metals.
6584:The walls of this mine have plenty of small burrows weaved throughout the structure, and you see faint movement within - something is watching you.{}{}{}{}As you move forwards, you see gold ore that shouldn't glimmer but it does, as if it were purified and smelted already. You cannot yet see the light source that could cause such an effect. 
6585:[Light]Call upon your domain for answers!
6586:Several creatures of all shapes and sizes appear before you, only to scatter away again. A lone karakandza demon stands firm and speaks in a slurping, almost growling voice:{}{}{}{}'Hmm, yes. Good. We had us a skshack who served Svarog. He helped us secure this place. Good fella, gone now...'
6587:Ask what they are protecting against -- the bandits?
6588:A voice answers from within the walls:{}{}{}{}'You smell like one of us, to be sure, but you also have that human-divine stench about you, so which is it?'
6589:Confirm that you are a servant of the divine.
6590:Deny any divine servitude. Say that it was never your choice, just chance. 
6591:Say that you are demon, nothing more.
6592:The gold is warm to the touch and its surface is indeed polished, even though some of it is clearly not mined yet.{}{}{}{}As you run your fingers over the metal, it whispers to you, and you recognise not only dwarven runes but also a touch of Svarog's blessing lingering in these walls.
6593:[Runemaster]Try to read the runes.
6594:[Light]Call upon the lord of light.
6595:Your connection to light flares up and blinds you with its sudden burst. {}{}{}{}In this flash, you know instantly that Svarog's touch protects this place. But what is odd is that it protects it from light...
6596:[Zerca or elf]Use your knowledge of the gods or light to study this place further.
6597:Call out to whomever resides here. Tell them you are here to make a deal, not fight.
6598:The runes are strong, but they were clearly made by a young runemaster, or perhaps one in too great a hurry to do their job properly! {}{}{}{}As shoddy a job as it is, the runes are meant to absorb the pure energy of light onto the gold ore and then into the ground. 
6599:This reaches into the eldest scripts before the darkest of nights, before the Awakening. {}{}{}{}You are too young to know more, but you know that this type of protection would only be needed against the strongest of light's emanations. There is of course a chance that creatures of true darkness lie within. After all, they would want light kept away.
6600:This place is beaming with power, but its source or sources are eluding your grasp. {}{}{}{}The walls seem to be pulsating with weaves of light, yet there is also a sense of stifling, a barrier that holds things tight and keeps something at bay.{}{}{}{}Whoever resides within is likely skilled in mysticism and determined to keep folk out. 
6601:You step in closer, carefully. You hear movement from the walls, and echoes of voices from within:{}{}{}{}'Begone. Leave. Away. Danger. Darkness. Lightness. Leave.'
6602:Say that you know they are trying to keep something at bay here, and perhaps you can help.
6603:If they don't wish to talk, keep moving forwards, weapons at the ready!
6604:You hear movement from the walls, and echoes of voices from within:{}{}{}{}'Begone. Leave. Away. Danger. Darkness. Lightness. Leave.'
6605:Several creatures of all shapes and sizes appear before you, only to scatter away again. A lone karakandza demon stands firm and speaks in a slurping, almost growling voice:{}{}{}{}'You sensed our walls, you know things. Maybe you are worth more alive. What do you know of our barrier?'
6606:Say that you know little, only that it is made to hold something back, perhaps even light itself? If so, ask them why.
6607:Tell them that you know they wish to keep light away. Ask them to speak quickly of what they need, as the fate of the world is at stake! [SKIP STORY]
6608:'The case is simple. The red-ridge bandits take us, cage us, and sell us. We want them dead. We can help you do the deed, but we need you to do the heavy work. Kill the bandits, and we both get what we want.'
6609:Disagree. Ask if there is any other way to convince them to leave this mine.
6610:Say that you must consider this.
6611:Refuse and just attack!
6612:'Why, why, you ask? Because it burns and shatters and takes those who are strong. We, karakandza, we once gnawed at the roots of the cosmic tree, and now it is hidden. {}{}{}{}Our friends, house demons, they have few houses to go to as the earth keeps swallowing all. {}{}{}{}Darkness was chased away and lurks only in the corners, so light bites back, bites hard.'
6613:Light is attacking demons?
6614:The creature shrugs:{}{}{}{}'I suppose you could say that. It comes and burns, and then those humans by the cave, they catch us, they cage us, they sell us as toys... So we made a fort, we're safe here. Or we were, until the humans started sending their thugs.'
6615:Admit that you are here on their behalf, but only because you need the cave.
6616:[Demon]Capturing demons, caging them, and selling them as toys! Swear that you will kill every last one of those bastardly bandits!
6617:He frowns:{}{}{}{}'Yes, I thought as much, but why do you need a cave so bad?'
6618:Tell them of the Alchemist and his plan to solve the mystery of the Shattering.
6619:'Aha. A world-saving thing. Yes, that cave does feel strong, sometimes it calls out to us, sometimes it makes us shudder. And the shakes come from it, that's for sure.{}{}{}{}Still, we can't give you our mine, it is ours, it is a safe haven. But we could help you kill the humans? That way we both get what we want.'
6620:'You're a creature of pure dark. You give us ALL of your spirit, yes, all - or at least close to it. We'll try to leave you some.{}{}{}{}With your darkness, we can hide for a time. Those bandit bastards will think we've left, and with the dark power - well, we may get our taste of their flesh yet. Win-win.'
6621:Say that you will kill the bandits after all.
6622:'You're a creature of light, elf. You give us ALL of your spirit, yes, all -- or at least close to it. We'll try to leave you some.{}{}{}{}With your light, we can strengthen this place. We have a yaga with us, she'll do us an illusion. Those bandit bastards will think we've left, and with the extra power -- well, we may get our taste of their flesh yet. Win-win.'
6623:'Fine with me. We aren't moving anyway.'
6624:The demons prepare a ritual and take those they need into a tunnel, where they drain their spirit almost to the brink of death!{}{}{}{}The cave's light dims and a cold mist descends:{}{}{}{}'Better go now. You folk don't do well when the mist comes.'
6625:The demons prepare a ritual and take those they need into a tunnel, where they drain their spirit almost to the brink of death!{}{}{}{}The cave's light grows even stronger, and its heat burns your skin:{}{}{}{}'Better go now. We'll make our spells and wait for those fuckers!' 
6626:'We're hiding here, but we're always looking for new ways to get stronger. Children are useful for our kin, in all sorts of ways. Give us one of yours.{}{}{}{}With their youth, we can do much. We have a yaga with us, she'll do us an illusion. Those bandit bastards will think we've left, and - well, we may get our taste of their flesh yet. Win-win.'
6627:The demons take their prize.{}{}{}{}The cave's light grows even stronger, and its heat burns your skin:{}{}{}{}'Better go now. We'll make our spells and wait for those fuckers!' 
6628:'We're hiding here, but we're always looking for new ways to get stronger. Life force is useful for our kin, in all sorts of ways. Give us all your pets.{}{}{}{}With their vitality, we can do much. We have a yaga with us, she'll do us an illusion. Those bandit bastards will think we've left, and - well, we may get our taste of their flesh yet. Win-win.'
6629:'Wonderful. We will hide for now, allow you better access. Beware, though - we do not make such deals twice, so you make it, you stick to it. You break it, we will never speak again. So you go lie to them, you speak the word and we come to help. Good luck.'
6630:Deal. Leave.
6631:'You done the deed? You killed those red-ridge bastards?'
6632:No. Come back later.
6633:No, attack the demons instead!
6634:'Ah, the winds of fate throw us as they will. {}{}{}{}We had us a skshack who served Svarog. He helped us secure this place. Good fella, gone now...'
6635:'Tricking tricksters is never easy, kin. And if you're here to lie to us, begone!'{}{}{}{}They scatter away and disappear in darkness.
6636:You move in deeper and the bright, hot light of the golden ore tingles, then burns your skin. You feel dizzy from the heat and dazed from the light.{}{}{}{}It is only now that you feel sure this cave is protected by strong powers, made to keep something strong at bay.{}{}{}{}You hear the clutter of claws and snarling getting more aggressive. You know you're surrounded!{}{}
6637:Shout to whomever surrounds you. Convince them you want to make a deal, not fight!
6638:'You are kin, but you are not us. We will say only that between the light burning us alive and the bastard bandits pestering our folk, we made this place safe and we aren't leaving.'
6639:Convince them you are a friend, and ask them to tell you more.
6640:You came here to do a job, kin or no kin. Attack!
6641:'Hmm, yes, you seem fair. Like I said, we guard against light and the bastards.'
6642:'Your words smell of deceit. I can taste those red-ridge scumbags on your breath! {}{}{}{}Leave or die!'
6643:Leave to regroup.
6644:'You again. Begone or be dead!'
6645:You kill most of the demons and those who survive clear away in a hurry. The mine is empty for the bandits to take, although you see much of the gold ore fade and turn to common stone.
6646:Go report your success to the bandits.
6647:'Wonderful news! I admit, I was betting against you. Well, a deal's a deal, here is your reward and a blessing. We've been to that cave - you'll need to be tough to get in where you need to. Good luck!'{}{}{}{}They scatter off into the tunnels.
6648:The demons beat you badly and force you to run, also draining some of your spirit. {}{}
6649:'You do not have anything we need. Children, pets, elven light - those you can bargain with.'
6650:'Wonderful friend! We will hide for now, allow you better access. Beware, though - we do not make such deals twice, so you make it, you stick to it. You break it, we will never speak again. So you go lie to them, you speak the word and we come to help. Good luck.'
6651:'You're back, so let me remind you of our dealings. The case is simple. The red-ridge bandits take us, cage us, and sell us. We want them dead. We can help you do the deed, but we need you to do the heavy work. Kill the bandits, and we both get what we want.'
6652:The cave is abandoned.
6653:'Fascinating. I've heard of such things. Of course, inanimate yet living is not a thing of myth in Slavya, no, but at this scale? This cave, it has residues of great power, but also echoes of life. {}{}{}{}Alas, I admit, I need help if I am to solve this.'
6654:Ask if you can help.
6655:[Runemaster]Nod. Bloodstones are a rarity and even you do not know much about them. Say that you will need to consult your kin, and an elder one at that. 
6656:[Elf]Add that you also sense an overwhelming imprint of light here, and the source seems to dwell somewhere much deeper. You will indeed need the counsel of an elder -- a dwarf will do. But an elder-kin master will surely do even better.
6657:[Dwarf]Admit that this is beyond even your own understanding of stone, and you will need an old stone master to tell you more.
6658:Ask him to tell you all this fast. [Skip Story]
6659:'Unless you happen to be a dwarven stone master, or perhaps an ancient who still remembers, no. {}{}{}{}We need to search for an expert. I will of course remain here. Study this cave more.'
6660:Ask where to search for such experts.
6661:'A blood cave, you say? Yes, makes sense, can you tell me more?'
6662:From what you know, they are the rarest of dwarven caverns, heavily guarded and said to hold the most ancient of secrets. Clearly the Shattering moved this one to the surface, for you could not imagine your kin abandoning it otherwise. But this one also seems wounded, damaged. Something more than the shakes happened here.
6663:Say that you will not reveal anything more. An expert is needed and they will decide if outsiders can share in the knowledge.
6664:'A burst of light, eh? I will test for that too, then, thank you. Yes, a master of your kind, old enough to have lived in the days before the Awakening -- they may hold such knowledge still. {}{}{}{}Although I would rather hear it from the horse's mouth, as it were. Dwarves seem inevitably involved in this. But your choice.'
6665:You finally enter the red cave and you now realise the meaning of its name. {}{}{}{}The walls and floor are rough, layered with blood-red moss and black veins. Faint crimson light lingers beneath this odd canopy, pulsating quietly in slow rhythm.
6666:Wait to see what the Alchemist wants to do.
6667:He stares, his mouth wide open and eyes lit up, and gestures for you to move forwards.{}{}
6668:You move through this odd tunnel and find several paths, some leading to small alcoves that are clearly used by the bandits as storage. Other paths are entirely collapsed. The only remaining way leads to what looks like an entrance to another, larger tunnel. {}{}{}{}But there is a membrane blocking your way.
6669:Ask the Alchemist what he thinks.
6670:[Magic users]Examine this barrier.
6671:[Dwarf or goblin]Search this entrance for a mechanism.
6672:[Orc or strength] Everything breaks, and this thing will too!
6673:The scholar takes his time to study the membrane, then speaks:{}{}{}{}'It is beyond me for now. But the samples tell me it is infused with old magic, yet at the same time is organic. Odd, very odd. {}{}{}{}I see two ways. We can work on a mystical solution or, well, bash it.'
6674:[Orc or strength] Force it open.
6675:You need someone strong, a magic user or a dwarf or goblin to figure this one out. Come back later. 
6676:For a time, you are sure the membrane will not break. With every swing, the odd substance simply repairs itself, and the gooey slime stings your skin and hurts your spirit. {}{}{}{}But finally, your force overwhelms the thing, and as you push through it, the barrier collapses in on itself. 
6677:Take a look around. 
6678:You stand in a dark chamber, covered still in the strange moss, but here, you see a deep hole in the middle, the earth and stone around it torn from within. {}{}{}{}And from this hole, cracks spread out like the sun's rays. They are small here, yet you see bright light within and you sense enormous power within, pulsating, spreading.{}{}{}{}And yet, from your divine connection, you also sense that this is a mere outlet, not the source.{}{}
6679:Turn to the Alchemist for answers.
6680:The membrane will not break. With every swing, the odd substance simply repairs itself, and the gooey slime stings your skin and hurts your spirit.
6681:Leave and come back when you're ready to face this challenge.
6682:You examine the structure of this barrier and sense ancient weaves of magic, combined with a life of its own as well as the artifice of dwarves. {}{}{}{}Through magic, you can weaken the weaves and thus hopefully walk through.
6683:Although magic and other mysteries are clearly at work here, you also spot the unmistakable craft of dwarven smiths. {}{}{}{}You uncover the mechanism that should open the barrier, but it will not be easy to master.
6684:Carefully, you unravel the complex weaves that keep the barrier up, and the whole thing collapses, allowing you to enter.
6685:Carefully, you study the ancient mechanism and with much care, you find the right combination to make it work. The barrier opens, allowing you to enter.
6686:You try to unravel the complex weaves that hold this barrier, but you cannot, and the effort exhausts your spirit.
6687:The mechanism is ancient and well crafted. You cannot break it, and the effort is exhausting.
6688:'Yes. We need to search for an expert. I will of course remain here. Study this cave more.'
6689:'That is an excellent question. I would wager that travelling to the lands of stone and metal where dwarven survivors now dwell is a sure bet. {}{}{}{}Now, you could also look for some elder long-ears - ehm, elves, that is. Once they're old enough, the likelihood that they meddled in the affairs of the world grows exponentially. Find them in ancient forests. And who knows, maybe goblins or orc know something? Just remember to find their villages, not just random folk.'
6690:Any other options?
6691:You enter the red cave. The Alchemist looks up from his many scrolls and vials:{}{}{}{}'Found some answers for us?'
6692:Yes. Tell him that he knows full well that  you rescued the dwarf. 
6693:Not yet. Leave.
6694:Tell him you got a new heart, made by a sorcerer from the last remaining giants. 
6695:Say that you agreed on an alliance with the elves. They should arrive here shortly.
6696:Say you have been given the heart of ice.
6697:'Failing that, I do know a place, but it will be a matter of brute force and likely much more difficult. A dwarven smith of great renown is held captive by trolls. I happen to know where. {}{}{}{}Go, free him, and he will be honour-bound to aid you.'
6698:Thank him for the help and leave to search for the expert.
6699:'Fascinating, thank you for sharing your knowledge, friend. And yes, this makes me even more certain that we need dwarven expertise here. Please, go find us a master runesmith.'
6700:Say that you've been out of touch with your kin for a time. Ask where to search for such experts.
6701:'Yes, right you are, master dwarf, right you are. But this makes me even more certain that we need dwarven expertise here. Please, go find us a master runesmith.'
6702:'I see, a mroki, you say. Yes, I read somewhere that they were indeed giants once. Still . . .'{}{} {}{}He looks at you for a moment, then nods:{}{}{}{}'You are the champions. It is and always will be your choice. I have found the entrance to the earth-cave where you must place the heart. Good luck!'
6703:He nods, and as you turn to enter the red cave, the elves arrive. Several of the emissaries are hooded and keep their distance. The one who speaks to you looks pale and sickly:{}{}{}{}'We know where to find the heart chamber and the light-beast that resides within. We will lead the way and together we can set things right.'
6704:Agree to meet them at the heart chamber.
6705:'The light-beast drew power from us because of our pure connection to the light. We decided to sever this connection willingly in penance for our kin's folly. {}{}{}{}This sacrifice also allowed us to acquire the heart of the forest from a forest demon. This will do as the new safeguard. And our condition will blindside the beast and help you defeat it. Alas, I am afraid we will not be much use in the fight itself, as we are weakened.'
6706:What does that mean, exactly?
6707:Thank them for the sacrifice and agree to meet at the heart chamber.
6708:'We have wilfully accepted darkness into our souls. The curse of the old days. Many will perish. Most will turn into shadow kin. But some will endure as we did before. So do not concern yourself with it. The choice was ours to make.'
6709:'So yer back with the blood, eh? Wasn't sure you had the bollocks to get it. Let us talk - come to my forge.'{}{}{}{}He leads you into a forge that was not there when you left.
6710:'Now, the blood will push life into a lifeless form, but it is by far the easiest of prices needed for this.'
6711:Ask him to tell you more of his story. Why was he in the prison? Why didn't other dwarves come to rescue him? He is a grandmaster runesmith, after all.
6712:Ask what is needed next.
6713:Ask for all the options to be laid out straight. No backstory needed. [Skip Story]
6714:You see the smith standing outside the red cave. He has his smithing hammer and several men are watching him.{}{}{}{}'Ya got the blood yet?'
6715:'I suppose they forgot about poor old me when the earth shook and cities were misplaced. One prison here or there, eh?'
6716:[Dwarf]Insist that he cut the bullshit. Dwarves would not forsake a grandmaster, as they are few and far between, almost like a dwarf-wife.
6717:But the Alchemist knew where he was?
6718:'Bah, I won't fool ya, will I? I am no grandmaster, not anymore. I was dishonoured, my beard torn, my name struck from stone forever. The fools! They did not understand -- the heart, the giant was weak, I had to find ways! It was all for them! '
6719:So the dwarves decided the prison was his punishment for breaking the dwarven code of ethics?
6720:'A learned man, that one, and like you, touched by your gods or what have ya. {}{}{}{}Listen, I was, well, not popular in my last days. Many of my men thought my methods crude or outlandish -- "too much change, Wilfred, you must stick to traditions." Creatures of stone and metal we are, we do not like change, ya see.'
6721:So they left him here because he was not liked?
6722:'Ethics! Ha! They are afraid, and they should be. I was able to command stone and bend metal to my will. The warrakus - an accident, a shameful sort - but I could make them again and again. The fools did not listen to reason. My runes are an art that they could not grasp. Stone idiots!'
6723:Ask if he regrets his cruel experiments.
6724:Tell him you understand that progress needs sacrifice at times.
6725:Did he just call dwarven elders, the very core of your esteemed society, idiots? How dare he!
6726:'Yer one to talk! Ya walk with them human gods now, eh? The forefathers ain't so clever for ya either?'
6727:Deny it. Say that you follow the gods but you also respect your old life. The two are not mutually exclusive.
6728:'No? Finny that. I'd have said they were. I'd swear no self-respectin' dwarf would pray to a god. So ya see, perspective. I call them idiots, and ya left them and found new fools to follow. Either way, we're both out. {}{}{}{}I will not speak of it more.'
6729:'Bit of this, bit of that, ya know how it is. Priorities, choices. We also live long, so I am sure they would have come back eventually.'
6730:'Cruel, bah! Exceptional, inventive . . . I do not care for suffering or pain, only results. I was there when the giant gave his heart and it opened my mind to such possibilities. I also knew this day could come. I warned the others, implored them to pursue my work, for the giant's heart was vulnerable, but they were too stubborn to listen.'
6731:Giant's heart?
6732:'Aye, good. So ya understand the process had no meaning, only the results. I was there when the giant gave his heart and it opened my mind to such possibilities. I also knew this day could come. I warned the others, implored them to pursue my work, for the giant's heart was vulnerable, but they were too stubborn to listen.'
6733:'Giants once walked the land. They sang the life-song and made mountains grow. Shapers and makers of our land. When other life came to be, the giants slept, but one gave us his heart to safeguard the earth, make it stick together.'
6734:Stick together?
6735:'Aye, like the cosmic tree that holds the skies and the dark up in the heavens, the heart was like a . . . hmm, a plug, maybe, to keep the earth from moving and the scorching light of the core down below. {}{}{}{}That's all I know, for I was a young'un then, focused on my work. I did not listen about the bigger things, and later they were locked away, kept secret even from me.'
6736:Ask what is needed now to stop the Shattering.
6737:'Kill most of the dwarves so they feed my master rune and thus make an extra-strong heart of the earth to replace the one that was lost. This will weaken the light-beast ya must face.{}{}{}{}Or go kill four dwarven champions in a tomb, then sacrifice yer faith and spirit to feed a much weaker heart that will not help ya in the fight with the final beast.'
6738:Agree to kill the dwarves and thus weaken the lightbringers greatly. Then go face the final challenge.
6739:Say that you will not sacrifice the dwarves. Agree to go kill the champions, then come back and give your own spirit to forge the weaker heart.
6740:'It depends, really. How much do ya know of the Shattering?'
6741:It broke the world, threatens to keep doing it, and some light creatures came out and keep attacking folk. And the gods want you to deal with it.
6742:'Yes, that covers it. In short, there was once a giant's heart that kept the light down under and kept the earth in one piece.{}{}{}{}The heart was broken by some fools. Now we need a new one. And yes, I can make one. But there are no more giants to lend a hand, so I need to improvise.{}{}{}{}And even when I have the heart, ya will still need to slay the light-beast that sits where the heart should be.'
6743:'To forge the heart of earth anew, I need another stone heart - in fact, many. This is what my kin were made for, sadly, and the time is now. We failed to keep the heart safe. Now our hearts will make a new one. {}{}{}{}If you agree to it, I will distribute a death-rune to my brethren. Once I craft another, the life-rune, it will connect with its dark twin and take power from it. This power will come at the expense of dwarven lives.'
6744:How many lives need to be sacrificed for this?
6745:'Many, perhaps most.'
6746:Most dwarves will die, and he is okay with it?
6747:Never!
6748:Ask Ail'yleth if this is why she convinced you to come here and not the elves. They would have to pay a similar price, right?
6749:'You are wise. Yes. This is why. But you do have more than one path here. Both are preferred to the sacrifice of my own kin. Let us not waste time - make up your mind, champion.'
6750:'Aye, like I said, the process is irrelevant, but the results matter. Those old fools need to die anyway. Stuck in their stone ways, metal heads too stubborn to learn. They pay the price for their own arrogance, for it was them that were supposed to keep the earth-heart safe.'
6751:How will their deaths be used?
6752:'The heart forged from their sacrifice will not only stop the Shattering, it will also be strong enough to pull the light back into the core. It will weaken all creatures taken by the lightbringers, including the beast that you must slay in order to place the heart where it belongs.'
6753:So he will make the runes, then forge a heart and power it with the deaths of dwarves. Then you will need to slay the light-beast and put the heart in a special place, yes?
6754:'Yes. Once the heart is where it should be and the light-beast is banished, things should eventually get back to normal. Until the next genius decides to screw with the world order.'
6755:Agree to take the life force from dwarves to forge a new, stronger heart and keep the light at bay.
6756:Refuse and ask for another option.
6757:He nods, his eyes darken, and a grin flashes across his stone-cold face:{}{}{}{}'Good, excellent! Yes, I mean. You made the right choice. Now I will finish the forging of the rune.'
6758:How will it affect the dwarves from afar?
6759:'I am one of only three grandmasters that live. Even if they choose to forget me, I forged the runes that keep their fires going. The death-rune will be placed by your Alchemist friend in one forge. It is enough to activate all the runes I ever made.{}{}{}{}This grand rune of life will then do the rest.'
6760:Nod and await the result.
6761:The grandmaster works at his anvil for several hours, carefully carving an intricate design onto a single, unimpressive slab of stone.{}{}{}{}You notice the tool he uses is dabbed in the druid-tree's blood, and with every stroke a faint red glow briefly lights up the design. The tension is high. 
6762:Keep watching.
6763:The grandmaster stops, puts the stone away, and begins to clean his tools. The Alchemist appears by your side:{}{}{}{}'I did not interfere with your choice. It was yours to make. Now it is done. No fireworks, no special effects, but the rune is working now. He will place it in the heart he forged, and we will have it ready when the light-beast is slain. I marked the entrance to the tunnels that will take you directly to the creature.'
6764:Nod and leave to find the beast.
6765:'I feared ya may be too soft to do the right thing, and since ya own my arse, I will not waste time arguing.{}{}{}{}I can make a weaker heart. You will need to defeat the four great dwarven champions that were supposed to guard the heart in the first place, but failed. With their demise I will forge an inferior rune. It will hold the earth and the light, but it will not weaken the beast that you must slay.'
6766:What was the beast again?
6767:Anything else?
6768:'I know nothing of it other than what the stone told me and what yer Alchemist found. There is a beast of light that has taken physical form and guards the chest where the heart must lie.'
6769:'Yes, your faith will be the price. My rune will take from you what is strongest. Your spirit will suffer immensely, but you will have a chance to heal it in time. So I advise not facing the light-beast until you are feeling better.'
6770:Agree to let the grandmaster forge the weaker rune and use your own faith as the power source.
6771:'Good, go bring me the remains of the champions, and I will have the rune ready.'
6772:'Ya got the dwarven guardian remains yet?'
6773:'Good. I will forge yer heart, and yer Alchemist friend will bring it to ya.{}{}{}{}Fools that ya are, I hope ya can beat the light-beast with this measly thing. Now go -- we marked the entrance to the earth-heart cave for ya.'
6774:'You are back. I have no new insights. {}{}I see two ways. We can work on a mystical solution or, well, bash it.'{}{}
6775:You enter the red cave but find it empty, covered only in silver ash.
6776:You get back to the red cave.
6777:Look for the dwarf.
6778:Look for the Alchemist.
6779:He nods, and as you turn to enter the red cave, the dwarves make themselves seen. The Alchemist speaks:{}{}{}{}Yes, I was informed of this and I am glad. We have the entrance to the light-beast's lair marked. Go, end this.'{}{}
6780:'Either go look for help in other, non-human factions, or go rescue a dwarven master runesmith.'{}{}{}{}He marks the runesmith's location on your map.
6781:You are ambushed by the scoundrels that took your goods earlier.
6782:'No, no, don't kill us! The earth keeps breaking, the light takes our folk away, bandits steal our young ones, we only take to live...'
6783:Let them live.
6784:'The earth keeps breaking, the light takes our folk away and bandits steal our young ones, so we take what we want! Now, leave us be, or we take you too!'
6785:'Thank you. We will go now, but because you're kind, we tell you - watch out in these lands. Demons are actin' weird, the Shattering's wreaking havoc, and red-ridge bandits are claiming more and more turf. Here, have our pup, he'll keep ya safe. Bye.'
6786:Tell them they better never steal from you again, then leave.
6787:More and more scavenger groups are roaming these parts lately, and they don't always care if you were once friends.
6788:'You ain't the enemy, but you ain't friends either. Go to our village if you wanna make friends. Now move away.'
6789:'Fine, fine, here, you take our shit and we back away. No need for fightin', and no hard feelings either, eh.'
6790:Angry bandits spot you, and they don't look like they're going to talk.
6791:'Welcome, come and see how we have changed since our bandit days. We may not be as rich, but we're honest folk now. What brings you here?'
6792:Say you just came to rest and visit.
6793:Ask if you can visit the kennels.
6794:'You best move along. We are now proper Slavyans, our bandit past is behind us and you are no friend to our folk!'{}{}{}{}You see armed folk gathering.
6795:Say that you mean them no harm -- all you want is to talk and visit.
6796:'There's always trouble about the place. There's a bunch of vermin nesting nearby. We're small, only setting up. If you help us be rid of them, we'll be very thankful, to be sure.'
6797:'It will be a cold day in summer before we refuse hospitality to the weary.{}{}{}{}We also have a healer in the village. If they're not busy, they're good with the body and the mind.'
6798:Ask if there's a wise one who can heal spiritual ailments.
6799:A zerca is telling the story of the cosmic tree. Go listen to his tale in honour of the gods.
6800:'There's always trouble about the place. There's a nice rich beehive nearby. We'd like to get the honey, but we're small, only setting up. If you help us pacify the bees, we'll be very thankful, to be sure.'
6801:'You lookin' to help a fellow, eh? Sure, there's always trouble.'
6802:You see they are in need of stone, so tell them you're willing to give away some of yours.
6803:'Yeah, nasty bunch of scoundrels are setting up nearby. You've done it before, so go beat them up for us again, will you?'
6804:'A witch, that's what you're after, eh? Magic comes at a price. Healing the spirit is easier, but curses, well, they are nasty things. They'll cost you more, cost you blood.'
6805:[Witch]Say you only need your sister's aid, and you'll pay the price yourself and promise not to burden her. 
6806:The witch nods. 'Bah, should've said so, sis. I wouldn't try to sell you the pricey crap, ha. Let's get to it.'{}{}{}{}Together, you remove any curses you had.{}{}
6807:'In the name of the cosmic tree itself, you are truly odd folk to offer resources like that. We thank you. {}{}{}{}We cannot give much, but here, have what we can spare.'
6808:'Sure, go right ahead, we may have some pups for you to buy.'{}{}
6809:Buy a dog. 
6810:'There's always trouble about the place. There's a bunch of nasty gobbos camping nearby. Little buggers are looking to stay, and we ain't too happy about them bein' our neighbours. If you were to deal with that, we'd be grateful.'
6811:'Bah, fine, you look honest enough and you carry the mark of the gods, so we best not anger them lot. {}{}{}{}Come in, but we're watching you!'
6812:'Go away!'
6813:'Either we do not have any work for you, or you or your kin are already set on a path to aid us. Finish that path before you ask for new tasks.
6814:You approach the beehive the Slavyans asked you to clear.
6815:[Druid or nature]There's no need for violence. You simply need to ask them to share.
6816:[Forest folk]Convince the bees to cooperate, as it is always more fruitful in the long run.
6817:[Beast master]You need to claim this territory. Any beasts will then move away. 
6818:[Hunter]Set up traps to thin the swarm, then attack.
6819:You find the right spots to mark your territory with a strong, predatory odour.{}{}{}{}The bees soon buzz away and leave their honey behind.
6820:Great. Go tell the villagers.
6821:You are badly beaten, and the villagers have to come to your rescue. They are not impressed.
6822:The bees buzz in unison, listening to your words. {}{}{}{}They agree to cooperate with the human village. If the humans keep away and leave them in peace, the bees will in turn give some of their honey away.{}{}
6823:A villager scout was watching you and approaches:{}{}{}{}'I'll be damned. You reasoned with the stingers, but why? We have no desire for the buzzers to live on our doorstep. {}{}{}{}I mean, you meant well. But perhaps next time, do as we ask.'
6824:The bees buzz in anger and turn your way.
6825:You will be stung, so run.
6826:A villager scout was watching you and approaches:{}{}{}{}'I'll be damned. You reasoned with the stingers. Great. I guess we won't mind the buzz if it gets us honey. Thank you, and here, this is your reward.'
6827:A villager scout was watching you and approaches:{}{}{}{}'I'll be damned. You chased them away. Wonderful! Here, have this as thanks.'
6828:You aren't called a beast master for nothing. You scare the bees away. A villager scout was watching you and approaches:{}{}{}{}'I'll be damned. You chased them away. Wonderful! Here, have this as thanks.'
6829:You find the place where goblins were supposed to have settled. It is a small but thick grove. {}{}{}{}You see some signs of humanoid presence, but no goblins yet.
6830:[Hunter or perception]Track the greenskins.
6831:You track the goblins to a small opening where they have set up a camp. It looks more like a travelling settlement than a village as the Slavyans suggested, but there are indeed many goblins here.{}{}{}{}Luckily for you, only a few have weapons at the ready.
6832:Surround the goblins and make your presence known.
6833:You have the advantage. Attack!
6834:You are ambushed by the goblins!
6835:You search the place and finally spot some goblins. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to choose a plan of action.
6836:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, only to tell them they need to leave because the Slavyans do not want them here.
6837:[Goblin]Say the hummies are being arseholes and want them gone. Ask if they can move along.
6838:You are badly beaten and the Slavyans have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.' {}{}
6839:'Right, right, yes of course, we meant no harm, we're not even a large-enough group to set up permanent-like. We got robbed, you see. And we have young ones who need rest and healing. But we move along now.' 
6840:Say that they do not need to leave, and you will explain their situation to the Slavyans.
6841:Nod and insist that they depart within a day. 
6842:You stay for a while and help the goblins heal. {}{}{}{}'Oh, thank you, thank you kindly. We  leave now as promised, but thanks to you we now have a chance to live on. Here, have this, not much, but all we can give.'
6843:'We have sick children, elderly, so we ain't moving. You face us with swords, or you go!'
6844:The goblins jump to their feet, weapons only half drawn:{}{}{}{}'Wait, wait, we don't have that much, please misters, please do not harm us.'
6845:Tell them the Slavyans do not want them as neighbours and they must relocate.
6846:The goblins depart, carrying their sick and trying to look brave.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
6847:The Slavyans are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
6848:The goblins are grateful for your mercy. They stay to heal their wounds, which may take some time.{}{}{}{}'Oh, we thank you, thank you kindly. Here, a small token of thanks.'
6849:The Slavyans, however, are not so happy with the results. They send their own forces to kill the goblins, and they tell you not to offer help unless you mean it.{}{}
6850:The Slavyans are not overjoyed with your 'solution', but in the end, they stick to your promises and let the goblins heal before they leave.{}{}{}{}The villagers leave you a small reward for your services.
6851:When you inform the Slavyans of your failure, they are disappointed in your efforts. 
6852:You kill the warriors and the rest flee. {}{}{}{}The Slavyans are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
6853:'Right, right, yes of course, we meant no harm, we're not even a large-enough group to truly set up permanent-like. We got robbed, you see. And we have young ones who need rest and healing. But we'll move along now.' 
6854:You find the vermin nest you were sent to clear.
6855:[Hunter]Set traps to lure the rats.
6856:[Beast master or wisdom]You know that rats are susceptible to a certain flute melody. 
6857:[Druid]No need to kill the rats. Try to coerce them into leaving.
6858:[Witch]Rats are your cohorts. Dominate the vermin and make them leave.
6859:Investigate this rat nest.
6860:[Rat]Go in alone and convince your vermin kin to leave here.
6861:You play the flute and the rats slowly begin to follow you. Some sink in the water already. You must hold the tune long enough to drown them all.{}{}
6862:Kill the ones left the old-fashioned way. Attack!
6863:Keep playing.
6864:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods and threaten the rats with the might of man and divinity. {}{}{}{}The rats listen and scamper away obediently, leaving you free to loot their nest. 
6865:Good, gather what you can.
6866:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods and threaten the rats with the might of man and divinity. {}{}{}{}But the fat rat in charge is not buying it. You are bitten and thrown out. The nest is unsettled.
6867:Try to walk away calmly.
6868:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods and threaten the rats with the might of man and divinity. {}{}{}{}The rats are so convinced by your words that they want you to be their new pack master. You would lead your own nest, have many baby rats, and bring the word of the gods to the vermin.
6869:Agree to take on the responsibility. [Lose one rat]
6870:Do not allow your rat friend to leave! Kill the female rat that is clearly the architect of this disaster!
6871:You set the traps and get rid of the vermin. {}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and give you a reward.
6872:You see a rat lurking. Approach it.
6873:The rat is very young and wounded, but you know how to train rats, so you can take him along with you.
6874:Nice.
6875:You find the bodies of many children, but also those of demons and animals. This nest was busy.{}{}{}{}More surprising, you discover in a central space, upon a throne of bones, a common cat, bound in a collar. Was it the master or the victim here?{}{}{}{}It purrs at you.
6876:Take the cat. 
6877:Kill the cat, for it is clearly the architect of this evil!
6878:You set up traps and kill most of the rats, while others scamper away. In one of your traps you discover a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. {}{}
6879:Search the place for survivors.
6880:The rats get spooked and swarm you within minutes. The villagers have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
6881:Your friend is distraught at your actions, but the nest scampers away in fear.
6882:The rats listen and scamper away from the village. Nature and harmony are satisfied by your actions.{}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and give you a reward.
6883:The rats listen and scamper away from the village.{}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and give you a reward.
6884:You get in closer and observe the rats. You soon realise that they are unusual. They seem to be building a prison of sorts with cages and holes, and you see bodies of their prisoners sticking out.
6885:[Hunter]Try to sneak in and set up traps to get rid of the vermin.
6886:[Druid or beastmaster]Play the flute to call the rats away, then try to rescue whomever you can.
6887:Attack the vermin!
6888:The villagers thank you for clearing the nest and give you a reward.
6889:The rats beat you badly and force you to flee. The villagers have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
6890:The nest is cleared. The villagers thank you and give you a reward.
6891:The vermin are dead or running away. One of the bodies, you discover, was a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings.{}{}
6892:The rats listen to your tune and obediently abandon their nest. You notice that one of them was actually a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. Most likely, it was not entranced by the flute but rather decided to flee while it could.{}{}
6893:The rats follow the tune and drown.{}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and give you a reward.
6894:You find the place where you were sent to deal with some folk attacking the Slavyans.
6895:You know how to deal with ruffians -- you dabbled in that life too. Speak to them. 
6896:Intimidate the ruffians. Tell them you'll leave none alive unless they go.
6897:[Intellect and harmony]Convince the scavengers that it is wiser to leave now than to face you or, later, the Slavyans too.
6898:Pay the scavengers to leave.
6899:You spot the scavengers ahead. They are busy kicking the head of a dead demon as if it were a ball. They haven't seen you yet.
6900:[Scavenger]Convince them it isn't worth the trouble to stay here because they'll get whooped either by you or by the Slavyans. Give them a tip on a different village they can hit, one with less protection.
6901:Barter with them and convince them it is best to leave now, before there is more trouble.
6902:Scavengers are after goods, so offer them some in exchange for leaving.
6903:You know their tactics, so the fight will be easier. Attack.
6904:'Shit, you guys look dangerous, we ain't messin' with you. We're gonna find another spot. Bye.' 
6905:Shake your fists at them.
6906:'Eh, why not, you one of us, so you good type. See ya around.'{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow. {}{}
6907:The scavengers scatter and even leave some of their stuff behind. {}{}
6908:'Yeah, you be right, methinks, you look like trouble, and them lot are growing too. We leave.'{}{}{}{}You dealt with the problem as asked, and you gain friendship.{}{}
6909:You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow. {}{}
6910:'Yeah, all right, deal's a deal, we move out.'
6911:You are about to report your success when you realise that the scavengers have no honour. They return to the village and attack again.{}{}{}{}They are eventually beaten by the villagers without your help, and your friendship suffers for it.
6912:You are defeated. Eventually, the folk who asked for your help deal with the problem themselves, so you do not gain any friendship.
6913:'You think you scumbags can come and tell us what to do? Fuck off!'
6914:'Ah, fine, fine, we ain't gonna shit on our friends? doorstep, we'll find a new patch.'{}{}{}{}You dealt with the problem as asked, and you gain friendship.{}{}
6915:The folk who asked for your help hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the scavengers themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
6916:'Bah, shut your trap, you turncoat! We ain't listenin' to traitors.'{}{}{}{}The scavengers attack. 
6917:'Ah, you sneaky buggers, you know what a bandit wants, good tradin' with ya.'{}{}{}{}They move on, and you gain the friendship of those who sent you here. {}{}
6918:'Give us some of your goods and we'll leave. We'll even trade with ya, if ya like.'
6919:'Yeah, you be right, methinks, you look like trouble, and them lot are growing too. But we ain't goin' for free. Pay us or we face the beatin'.'
6920:You discover the ruins of an ancient city. Within its shattered walls, you spot an entrance to a dungeon. This is where the Alchemist said the dwarven rune grandmaster is held captive by trolls.
6921:The dungeon was clearly designed to keep some large creatures captive. You spot cells where massive skeletons lie chained to the rock. Some may even belong to dragons.{}{}
6922:[Dwarf]Take a closer look at the ruins.
6923:[Perception or luck]Examine the place carefully.
6924:[Beast or night demon]Smell your way into the dungeon.
6925:Explore the dungeon.
6926:You've heard of places built by your dwarven kin to hold mythical monsters. Some say it was done for amusement, but you know it was for learning. The runemasters of old were said to collect those creatures in an attempt to bind their powerful spirits to stone and metal, thus creating runes of magnificent strength - awful stuff to be sure, but marvellous at the same time.
6927:Head straight for the eastern passageway. You know this is where the main holding cells would have been, so it is likely where the dwarf is kept.
6928:Even though there is likely danger, explore some of the cells anyway before trying to rescue the dwarf. You may find something useful here.
6929:This place was clearly a prison of some sort, built to hold extremely large creatures, perhaps even dragons.{}{}{}{}Some cells hold the skeletal remains of such monsters, and other cells are empty or contain piles of ash. You also notice that some of the dirt has been disturbed, so you may not be alone in here.{}{}{}{}You uncover some arrows and sigils written in the common tongue that suggest the direction of a central cell, likely where the dwarven prisoner is kept.
6930:Go rescue the prisoner as you came here to do.
6931:Explore the old cells first.
6932:This place was clearly a prison of some sort, built to hold extremely large creatures, perhaps even dragons.{}{}{}{}Some cells hold the skeletal remains of such monsters, and other cells are empty or contain piles of ash.{}{}{}{}There are several corridors, and you have no indication of where the dwarven prisoner is held.
6933:Try to find your way to the prisoner without detours.
6934:This place was clearly a prison of some sort, built to hold extremely large creatures, perhaps even dragons.{}{}{}{}Some cells hold the skeletal remains of such monsters, and other cells are empty or contain piles of ash.{}{}{}{}Your keen sense of smell tells you there are creatures yet living in this underground place, and you also catch the distinct odour of old stone soaked in spirits - likely the dwarf you are looking for. 
6935:As you enter one of the cells, a trap door opens beneath your feet and you fall down into a dark space with squishy debris under your feet. You hear the sound of stone slowly moving somewhere nearby.
6936:[Dwarf or goblin]A classic trap - the walls are going to squash you, and your guts would normally feed whatever beasts still lived here. There is usually a hidden safety switch, so find it!
6937:[Perception or night creatures]The walls are moving! Try to find a way out, quickly.
6938:Get your bearings and try to find out where you are.
6939:You light your torches or get your eyes used to the dark, and only then do you realise that the walls are closing in on you!{}{}
6940:Use brute force to try to keep the walls from crushing you while you search for a way out.
6941:[Wisdom]Most of the bones here are crushed, but you spot one that you know belonged to a zmey. Check it quickly. 
6942:[Strength]Hold the walls and move towards the exit, then break it open.
6943:[Bodyless forms]The trap cannot hurt you and doors cannot keep you. Quickly find a way out for your less fortunate friends.
6944:Zmeys are serpent-like dragons, ancient and born of chaos. Their bones are thin but very durable, and lucky for you, one such bone lies beneath your feet.
6945:Use it to slow down the trap and find a way out. 
6946:You push your way towards what looks like an exit and kick the door open before the deadly walls can crush you.
6947:Try to find that dwarven prisoner now.
6948:You manage to make your way to a door before the walls crush the life out of you. You force it open. Lucky for you it was old enough to crumble under pressure.
6949:The walls come closer, your strength fails you, and the door on the other side is locked. You feel your body being squeezed, your intestines shifting, and your bones slowly bending under the pressure. {}{}{}{}It is only through sheer luck or an act of the gods that the mechanism jams before it becomes lethal for you, and eventually you get the locked door open.
6950:You noticed the trap in time to run to what looks like the way out. Once at the door, you still need to get it open.
6951:[Strength]Kick it open, fast.
6952:[Intelligence]You spot hidden hinges and see they are old and rusty. You quickly dismantle the door and run out. 
6953:Force it open. Then go looking for the dwarf prisoner.
6954:You make your way towards the exit, find enough space to squeeze through to the other side, and open the door for your comrades.
6955:You quickly make your way to where you know such a switch is embedded and you stop the trap. You can now collect any goods in peace before moving on.
6956:You make your way into a deep, dark tunnel that collapsed at some point in the past and is now propped up by odd pieces of stone and metal. {}{}{}{}Finally, you get to the end and find a large prison cell. In the middle of this huge space designed for a dragon, you see a lone drunken dwarf, singing and talking to himself:{}{}{}{}'If I were a rich man . . . oh, how did it go? Eh, over the mountain pass? My gold lies? Eh . . .'
6957:Speak to the dwarf, but try to stay alert as there are bound to be guards here, after all.
6958:[Perception or dwarf]Stay hidden and examine the cell for any weak points, guards, and such.
6959:'Guests, here? Oh. Ya best keep yer distance, laddies, else the rock-shits'll have ya for lunch.'
6960:Ask if he means trolls. Where are they?
6961:Say you have no time to chat. Tell him you need to get him out so he can help with an urgent matter, a red cave that seems to be key to the Shattering.
6962:'They're here. Sleeping, or watchin', who knows . . . Why ya here? Come to laugh at me, eh?'{}{}{}{}{}{}
6963:Ask him why he is here, and for how long.{}
6964:Ask him what this prison was for?
6965:Tell him you need to get him out so he can help with an urgent matter, a red cave that seems to be key to the Shattering.
6966:'Why? So yer not here to laugh? I was the head of this here prison, a grand old runemaster, grandmaster, me, yes, one of the elders, that was me . . . Then the ground shook, the prisoners got away, and my kin washed their hands off me, said I was crazy. Fools! Afraid to spill some blood. Then the trolls and their lot decided to punish me.'
6967:'Research! Knowledge, understanding. Bah. I was never cruel. I loved my subjects, I cared for them. They suffered for the good of dwarf kind! Not that those stone heads deserve it, no, no, they will pay . . .'{}{}
6968:But what sort of knowledge did he need from all those large beasts?
6969:The dwarf cowers and turns away from you as he mutters:{}{}{}{}'I . . . I am sorry. I didn't know ya wanted to help. Too late now . . .'{}{}{}{}You are suddenly very aware that the walls around you are not walls. They have eyes, they have mouths and arms, and they are smiling at you:{}{}{}{}'So you want our toy, do you? Play with us first.'
6970:Say you would like to talk about this.
6971:Prepare for a fight.
6972:'Mythical beasts, powerful demons, troll kind that is so akin to us dwarves. They held their secret and the runes that I was able to craft - epic! No grandmaster could ever match me, yet they all shied away from it, the shame . . .'
6973:Ask him why he is here, and for how long.
6974:The doors to the cell open and the ground beneath your feet changes to slippery mud that pushes you in. From the dark corners you also see several more sets of eyes - some red hot, some ice cold, all large and angry.
6975:[Magic user] Keep talking and ask them if they will release the dwarf. But also, quietly prepare a ritual that will let you attack them in the spirit realms.
6976:Ask the trolls why they keep this dwarf here. Perhaps you could pay them for him?
6977:Convince them that a long time has passed and you need the help of this dwarf to help stop the Shattering. Tell them they should not be like him, or else they will remain his prisoners for good.
6978:Damn this dwarf run for your lives!
6979:Tree roots break through the floor. You hear another voice answer, an old, tired voice:{}{}{}{}'Wee keeep him here, asss hee keept uss. He took pieces of uss, now we cannot leave thiss place, sso he stayss, sufferss with uss.'
6980:Ask them what exactly was done to make them unable to leave.
6981:Use the ritual and attack the creatures!
6982:Attack with brute force!
6983:The dwarf answers your question:{}{}{}{}'I took their hearts. I needed them, to make one. A magnificent one! They live only as shells, a warrakus, but grander and better! They cannot leave for it is my runes that keep them alive now. And no, I cannot craft them better ones - these are already marvels beyond your small brain's understanding.'
6984:Tell the creatures that you can see why they keep him here. 
6985:A warrakus?
6986:You have a job to do here. Attack the jailers!
6987:The troll who first spoke answers you:{}{}{}{}'We are all of the earth, friends. We should serve as we once did, or we not any good no more. Thiss was fun, but games be over. You take the dwarf, but you promise he not go free! He be evil.'
6988:Make the promise.
6989:Say you cannot make such a promise, as he committed no crimes towards you, so you will not imprison him.
6990:[Dwarf]Make an oath and promise to deliver him to dwarf kind for proper judgement.
6991:'You speak for your gods, yes? I can sense it in your tone, smell it on you. You agree to give uss your spirit, lots of it so we may live. You can take this prison master with you.'
6992:Agree to pay the price with your own spirit.
6993:Promise that he will not go free.
6994:As you speak the words of the promise, you feel their unnatural weight and know they are no mere utterance. You are now bound by a demon deal. You do not know the consequence of breaking it, but there will be one.
6995:Take the dwarf back to the red cave.
6996:The Alchemist appears en route with a jovial smile:{}{}{}{}'Ha! So you went straight for the fight - good, good. This old fella's not what you call ethical, but he knows his stuff. Let me take him off your hands now. Come see us in the red cave when you can, and perhaps we will have some answers for you.'{}{}{}{}Before you are able to answer fully, the Alchemist wraps his hands around the rescued grandmaster and breaks open a vial of purple liquid, making them both disappear. You think they went into the greyworld, although only goblin shamans are known to travel that way.
6997:'Ah, a creation of my peers -a marvel of metalworks, rune mastery, and something else. Armour that moves and has a heart. Humans often claim they are creatures man made, wizard spells gone wrong, curses, but it is not so. Harnessing life to awaken stone and metal - the basis of my own work as well.'
6998:'Yess, cruel mind, filled with ambition. Ignorant of the lawss of nature. Payss the price now, and perhapss we are all paying it. Asss you ssay, he likely knowss of the Shattering.'
6999:'NO! Godss or no godss, we do not care for your troubless. You go noow, or we crush you.'
7000:You enter the dwarven prison once more and find it changed. The tunnels are darker, the air heavier, and you see only one path ahead of you, likely leading into a trap.
7001:Keep your weapons at the ready and go in. 
7002:[Magic user]Prepare yourself spiritually and attack the creatures in the spirit realm.
7003:'The price iss paid. With your stroong sspirit touched by the divine, we maay linger heeere for a time, perhapss even find a way out. Take him, use him. Beware of hiss treachery!'
7004:Thank them and take the dwarf back to the red cave.
7005:When you defeat the creatures in the spirit world, their physical bodies turn to dust and bone as if it was only through mystical powers that they yet lived.{}{}{}{}The dwarf breathes a sigh of relief:{}{}{}{}'Well, I admit, I didn't think ya'd do it. Bravo!'
7006:Tell him he is not free yet. He must now help you with the red cave mystery.
7007:'Aye, aye, despite what my kin say, I have not forgotten my honour! I will repay my debts, but centuries in this cell have made my brain foggy. Take me to your cave, I will rest and do the work.'
7008:Agree and take him to the red cave.
7009:The creatures look at you with mistrust - clearly dwarven oaths are not especially worthy to them. But they accept nonetheless. As you speak the words of the promise, you feel their unnatural weight and know they are no mere utterance. You are now bound by a demon deal. You do not know the consequence of breaking it, but there will be one.
7010:You are defeated and forced to run away. Some of you may have been caught by the angry creatures.
7011:You defeat the creatures and, in death, they breathe a sigh of relief as their long imprisonment ends. The dwarf looks surprised:{}{}{}{}'Well, I admit, I didn't think ya'd do it. Bravo!'
7012:[Dwarf or goblin]A classic trap -- the walls are going to squash you, and your guts would normally feed whatever beasts still lived here. There is usually a hidden safety switch, so find it!
7013:With every step you observe the walls and floor that surround you and notice irregularities. {}{}{}{}Soon you become aware that these tunnels are alive. Eyes are watching you from the shadows, and slow, heavy creaks of movement follow your every step. 
7014:Speak to the dwarf, but remain vigilant of these observers.
7015:You search a few cells and find some old bones and loads of dust.
7016:You search a few cells and find some old bones and loads of dust, but you also realise the air here is poisonous and you feel ill.
7017:The Alchemist ghost appears en route with a jovial smile:{}{}{}{}'Ha! So you went straight for the fight - good, good. This old fella's not what you call ethical, but he knows his stuff. Let me take him off your hands now. Come see us in the red cave when you can, and perhaps we will have some answers for you.'{}{}{}{}Before you are able to answer fully, the Alchemist wraps his hands around the rescued runemaster and breaks open a vial of purple liquid, making them both disappear. You think they went into the greyworld, although only goblin shamans are known to travel that way.
7018:Ail'yleth meets you inside and joins you. She also brings some spells that should aid you further.{}{}{}{}The dungeon was clearly designed to keep some large creatures captive. You spot cells where massive skeletons lie chained to the rock. Some may even belong to dragons.{}{}
7019:[Perception or scout]Examine the place carefully.
7020:You get out while you can. Perhaps looking for other paths, the elves, dwarves, goblins or orcs may have some answers for you. Maybe search for their villages.
7021:The elven mage whispers to you:{}{}{}{}'Will leave for now. I shall return when you have the new heart from this dwarf, then we will proceed with our plan.
7022:You come to where the dwarven prisoner was supposed to be held, but you find the earth parted and only rabble where the entrance once was.
7023:'Ah, yes of course, I was just testing you.'
7024:Ask about the dwarf.
7025:'Oh, him. Odd sort of fella. Five minutes in and he wants to test this cave with some dead things.{}{}{}{}In any case, I sent him to a forge to make me a rune. Don't worry - he's under guard.'
7026:So did they discover anything?
7027:'Yes, the old sod is mad. He calls this an earth stone cave, says it is one of the arteries of the earth-heart. {}{}{}{}Now what he refers to as the heart sent him off on an anxiety attack. He mumbled to me about the sacred duty failed, stone guards misused, and more importantly, the world breaking.'
7028:Can he get more sense out of the dwarf? 
7029:Ask him to tell you the short version, as time is of the essence. 
7030:'In short, all right. An ancient stone heart that is the core of the cosmic tree is missing or destroyed. This causes the earth to break, as far as I can tell. {}{}{}{}This chamber is connected to others like it, life-caves or earth-caves from the earth-heart, and we can use the dwarf to get to the central chamber, where we can try to discover what happened to this heart.'
7031:So what does the dwarf need to reach this inner chamber?
7032:'From what I gathered, the cosmic tree is the linchpin that holds divine power, and it is also the guardian against darkness. But what no one knew was that at the core - deep, deep beneath the earth - the roots are connected to a heart, an earth-heart or seed. He does not know why the earth shattered without the heart, but he knows it is connected.{}{}{}{}Now, this heart not only feeds the tree, but also keeps something else at bay -- the dwarf called it the burning light. With the emergence of the lightbringers all over the land, I suspect it is a creature of theirs.'
7033:'These red caves, or life-caves, are like the veins of this heart - living stones. The grandmaster would not say how. He insists it is a dwarven secret and shall not be told. {}{}{}{}But most importantly, judging from this place, he said the heart is gone, dead or stolen. And this set him off like crazy. Couldn't get much more out of him after that.'
7034:Does he know where to find this heart? Or at least where it was taken from?
7035:'Yes. The life-caves are connected, so I had the grandmaster carve me a rune to open the passage from here. This will take us to the central chamber where a stone ribcage awaits a new heart. I strongly suspect there to be a creature of light guarding it now. {}{}{}{}And I have been warned that ancient heroes may stand guard, and that even if the heart is gone, they will most likely be only more aggressive in their duty.'
7036:But wouldn't they be dead? 
7037:'I don't know how the culprits got past them, but no, they stand guard still - something about runes made of mythical hearts that the grandmaster was very proud of.'
7038:So what does the dwarf need to get us to this inner chamber and reforge a heart?
7039:'Well, since you embarked on this direct approach, not seeking aid from other factions, I am afraid brute force will be needed again. {}{}{}{}There is a forest, and within it lies a special tree. Some say it is an elven druid who became one with their domain, and that there are more of them in the ancient forests. Who knows? The dwarf wants the blood of the druid-tree.'
7040:Isn't there another way?
7041:Agree to go look for the druid-tree.
7042:'Not that I know of. But you never know, you've surprised me before.'
7043:Although it seemed like only a patch of forest from afar, the closer you get to the druid-tree, the more the woodland seems to grow around you.{}{}
7044:[Forest folk or Nature]Call out to the trees, as they are clearly aware of your presence here. Ask to be taken to the druid-tree.
7045:[Hunter or perception]Go look for the druid-tree. 
7046:Go look for the druid-tree. 
7047:The forest answers and a path clears before you. At the end of it, you see the druid-tree welcome you with her open arms:{}{}{}{}'Children of the forest, you called and I answered. Although it is a dark desire I sense within you, I cannot ignore it. And yet I am not as willing to part with my existence as one would hope . . .'
7048:Explain that you are here to solve the mystery of the Shattering and restore order. Say that you were told you need her blood for it.
7049:This forest is deliberately hiding the right path from you and would lead you astray were it not for your keen senses. With some effort, you come to a clearing where the druid-tree awaits:{}{}{}{}'Although yours is a dark desire and my guardians beg me to keep you away, there is also a great purpose I sense within you, so I cannot ignore it.'
7050:Say that you need her help to discover why the earth is shattering.
7051:You walk in circles for hours and you know this forest is deliberately hiding the right path from you. Eventually, tired and angry, you come to a clearing where the druid-tree awaits:{}{}{}{}'Although yours is a dark desire and my guardians beg me to keep you away, there is also a great purpose I sense within you, so I cannot ignore it.'
7052:You slay the druid-tree and its guardians. The body does not bleed at all - it is only filled with tree sap and wood. But you find a flesh heart that is pumping with hot red blood. {}{}
7053:Take the heart and leave.
7054:'Yes, we have long felt that the heart of the earth has stopped, and when the sister-tree Mokosh disappeared, leaving only her young offspring to watch over us, we knew this day would come.'
7055:Ask if she can tell you more of this earth-heart that stopped beating.
7056:If she was ready for it, does she know what is needed, and will she give it to you?
7057:'I was willing to aid you, or to listen at least, but you are bathed in darkness and destruction. You are not worthy of this mantle and will be wise never to return here!'{}{}{}{}You feel your spirit drained, then everything goes blurry. When you wake, you stand outside the forest line.{}{}
7058:'I was willing to aid you, or to listen at least, but you are bathed in darkness and destruction! Were you wise enough to stop this bloodshed, or just scared of our might? It matters not. You are weak and pathetic - begone!'{}{}{}{}You feel your spirit drained and the guardians watching your every move.{}{}
7059:[Wisdom]Apologise profoundly for your mistake. Swear that you did not intend for this bloodshed, but the stakes are so high that you were overwhelmed with passion.
7060:Try to convince her that you have learnt your lesson and would never do this again. Implore her to listen to your plea, as the world depends on it!
7061:'We have long felt that the heart of the earth has stopped, and when the sister-tree Mokosh disappeared, leaving only her young offspring to watch over us, we knew this day would come.{}{}{}{}I will not give up my own blood for you, but I will send you to a place where you can find it.'
7062:Agree to do what she asks.
7063:'You are not worthy of this mantle of the chosen, and you will be wise never to return here!'
7064:'Matters of the deep earth are not of our realm. They belong to the stone folk. Yet our roots reach deep into the ground, so we sense things.{}{}{}{}The heart was what kept the earth whole. It was a living thing, I think.'
7065:How did it hold the earth together? 
7066:'That I do not know, but it is likely something to do with the giants of old. They were the ones that sang the song of life, made mountains and fields. They are the fathers of the stone folk you call dwarves. {}{}{}{}So, I imagine, just as the elven kin were given stewardship of the cosmic tree, and that keeps the heavens from falling on us, so too did the dwarves use the heart to keep the earth from collapsing.'
7067:But the cosmic tree is a divine place. Is the earth-heart also?
7068:'Yes and no. There are laws older than your gods. While the tree was given to the pantheon, the heart remained hidden even from the divine. {}{}{}{}On the other hand, did Mokosh, mother earth, not know it? Did Veles, the keeper of the tree's roots, not feel it as we do? Doubtful. But they are gone, and the young ones rule. They must make it right.'
7069:[Nature]Call upon your domain, touch the roots of the druid-tree, and let the earth speak to you.
7070:You hear the lively bustle of the forest, the quiet concerto of the wind in the leaves, and the thumping of underground water veins rushing ever forwards. {}{}{}{}But you also sense an odd deafening silence -- a dark spot where you feel a rhythm should set the tune for all to follow. 
7071:Look up at the druid-tree with understanding.
7072:'Now you know, little champion. So we must prevail, and for that, you need my blood, yes?'
7073:Nod and explain the situation. 
7074:'Because you are of the forest, a child of nature -- if not directly, then by the path of your gods - I will end my existence for your cause. But I ask a boon of you in return. Will you agree to it?'
7075:'I will hand you a hatchling from my branch, and you will carry it to the ancient forest and give it into the hands of a feral. Beware, Dieva's ferals are not easy to speak to.'
7076:Dieva's ferals?
7077:Agree to take this hatchling and find the ferals. But ask how they will know what to do with it.
7078:[Dievanna]What do these ferals have to do with your lady?
7079:'They are like me in many ways. Once they were the elder children, druids. But their devotion to nature grew ever stronger while the laws of your societies grew ever more distant. For me, the call was to connect with the tree, listen, and forever stand guard. For them, it was the call of the wild, the beast within, untamed.'
7080:So they were both elves before? Why are the ferals called Dieva's?
7081:Agree to take the hatchling and find the ferals. But ask how they will know what to do with it.
7082:'Yes, elf is another name we bore. Dievanna too followed our path, but hers led to divinity. She remains somewhat of a patron to the ferals, I suppose - a mother-sister.'
7083:'You only need to leave the hatchling close enough so they see it. Do not worry about the rest. Although please do not spook them, for they can be violent. Nature will take its course if you do it right. I will live on or perish - that is of no consequence - but my seed needs to find its way into the right hands.{}{}{}{}Now, strike me in the heart and collect your blood. May nature smile upon you and guide you to save us.'
7084:Bow in thanks.
7085:Is there no other way to take the blood?
7086:She reaches into her belly and tears the flesh to produce an egg-like object encased in tree bark. When you take it, you notice it is warm and pulsating. {}{}{}{}You then take a blade and strike the druid-tree through her chest as asked. Deep red blood trickles out, much darker and thicker than you expected from an elf-like creature. 
7087:'I do not have blood in my veins as humans do. Only my heart beats with the life force of mortals. This is why it is special, and I imagine it is why the dwarven smith needs it to power his creation. Worry not, friend, for I am one with nature, and I do not fear the change.'
7088:'Are you worried that you are not the only chosen, children? Fear not -- the ferals follow Dievanna, but they were not made by her. They are like me in many ways. Once they were the elder children, druids. {}{}{}{}But their devotion to nature grew ever stronger while the laws of your societies grew ever more distant. For me, the call was to connect with the tree, listen, and forever stand guard. For them, it was the call of the wild, the beast within, untamed.'
7089:'No?'
7090:Say that you have no time for favours. You need the blood and you need to go.
7091:'How . . . sad. Well, my dear, I NEED and WANT a favour before I willingly give my life away.{}{}{}{}Seeing as you showed your crude nature, my offer has changed. I will not give you my life. But I offer you a chance to get druid-tree blood from another -- one that is lost anyway and needs to be released.'
7092:Say that you would rather do the initial favour.
7093:Agree to find this other druid-tree, and ask for details.
7094:'A druid-tree fell into the hands of dark fiends, mroki and the wretched shadow kin. The tree is dying, for it lacks light and balance. I sense its pain. The corruption is sickening.{}{}{}{}Go, destroy those who did it, and then strike the druid-tree through the heart. It will be a mercy, and your task will be achieved too.'
7095:Say that you will do as she asks, and leave.
7096:'Yes, and perhaps. You need my blood, for it can revive the heart that is broken. Because you are of the forest, a child of nature -- if not directly, then by the path of your gods -- I will end my existence for your cause. But I ask a boon of you in return. Will you agree to it?'
7097:'Your plight is indeed great, yet I have learnt to respect the laws of nature. What will come must be. I will not aid you willingly.'
7098:'Seeing as you showed your crude nature, my offer has changed. I will not give you my life. But I offer you a chance to get druid-tree blood from another -- one that is lost anyway and needs to be released.'
7099:'You come back for more!'{}{}{}{}The forest is ready to fight you.
7100:Apologise profoundly for your mistake. Swear that you did not intend for this bloodshed, but the stakes are so high that you were overwhelmed with passion.
7101:'I thought I made myself clear. I do not wish to aid you.'
7102:[Nature, Harmony or Light]Implore her to listen to your plea once more. Call upon your divine domain for aid!
7103:The forest is quiet and ordinary. You walk and walk but do not find traces of the druid-tree anywhere.{}{}
7104:As you walk through the forest, you encounter signs of Dieva's ferals roaming the area.{}{}{}{}You still have the druid-tree hatchling on you, so you could pass it on to them as you were asked. But before you are able to make that decision, an old woman walks up to you.
7105:Ask her what she wants.
7106:Avoid her and find a way to hand over the hatchling to the ferals.
7107:Ignore the woman and just throw the hatchling away -- you forgot you had it anyway.
7108:'Ah, hello there, children. Fancy meeting you here, eh? I noticed you handling that druid-tree hatchling just now and, well, I want to buy it off you.'
7109:Seems like a great coincidence.
7110:What is she offering in return?
7111:Refuse and find a way to hand over the hatchling to the ferals.
7112:The ferals are not known for their kind nature, so when you spot one in the distance, you know not to move any closer without a plan.
7113:[Nature]Call upon the forest to guide your path and find a safe place for the hatchling to be found by these ferals.
7114:[Forest folk]Call upon the forest to guide your path and find a safe place for the hatchling to be found by these ferals.
7115:[Hunter]Find the best spot to place the hatchling where you think these ferals will find it.
7116:Try to find the best spot for this hatchling while keeping your distance from these ferals.
7117:Attack the ferals, then let one live and hand it the hatchling. 
7118:'I will leave you this box of unknown loot. A matter of chance, you see.'
7119:'Chance, fate -- these are all my playthings. Does it matter? I wish to acquire the object, that is all.'
7120:The forest guides you to leave the hatchling inside an old tree trunk. From afar, you see the ferals circle it, and you hope they were the ones you were supposed to leave it for. {}{}{}{}You feel the forest approves of your deed as your morale lifts.
7121:You find a spot to leave the hatchling, but you are not sure if the ferals noticed it. {}{}{}{}In fact, you spot them leaving, and when you try to find the hatchling again, you see only a broken shell and some squirrel tracks.
7122:You did your best. Leave.
7123:You beat the ferals and they try to scatter. As they do, you throw them the hatchling and hope they will not think it is another violent attack.{}{}
7124:As the ferals leave, they trample the hatchling. You feel a curse befall you as the wind whispers of broken vows.
7125:The ferals beat you badly and force you to flee. You realise the hatchling was trampled during the fight.
7126:The forest where you were sent on the trail of another druid-tree is dark and steeped in black mist.{}{}
7127:[Turmoil or magic]You sense a strong presence of darkness here. Call upon your domain to guide you.
7128:You feel your domain surround you and a path opens through the mist. You walk a while and are met by a shadow elf:{}{}{}{}'What do you seek here, stranger? I sense some affinity to change and dark mists of magic upon you, yet you are not one of us.'
7129:[Shadow elf]It is true that you follow the path of the gods now, but you are still shadow kin. Reaffirm this.
7130:Tell them of your dire need for the druid-tree.
7131:Attack the shadow elf -- after all, this is what the druid-tree asked for!
7132:'Ah, the druid-tree and its sad tale, yes. It has fallen deep into a chasm of pure darkness. There it lingers, resistant to the change, yet unable to be free. {}{}{}{}Even we do not go near it.'
7133:Is there a way to get to it safely? 
7134:'Safely? No. But there are ways. We have been watching it, for it interests us how this ancient thing can withstand the call of the dark when we could not. Do we watch it out of spite, or shame? Both, maybe?{}{}{}{}We are not bothered if you wish to "rescue" it. Go ahead.'
7135:Go find the druid-tree.
7136:You approach the place where the shadow kin say the druid-tree lies, but you cannot see it through the thick black mist. {}{}{}{}You are told it lies in a hole, and that it has no strength to climb out on its own.
7137:[Shadow elf]The black mist is not as bad for you. Run in for the druid tree, with all the darkness damage, it should be light enough to carry out.
7138:[Magic user]Prepare a weakening ritual to dispel this mist and get to the tree.
7139:[Intellect or light]Call upon your domain to cut through this darkness and let you pass. 
7140:[Wisdom]The black mist attacks your mind and causes you to see your worst fears. Steel your mind, stay strong, and concentrate on your divine connection as you walk in and take the druid-tree out.
7141:Run in for the druid tree, with all the darkness damage, it should be light enough to carry out.
7142:The black mist yields to your strength and you are able to recover the druid-tree. But you see that it is nothing like the one you met earlier. Its roots and trunk are blackened and pulsating with corrosive sap, its elven parts torn to the bone and twisted. It is dying, but you feel its death will take a long, long time.
7143:Shorten its suffering and strike the heart as you were told.
7144:Try to carry it to the other druid-tree. Perhaps something can be done after all.
7145:Kill it and take its blood.
7146:'And yet, you walk in the light. I smell the sweet corruption in you lessened and the heavy hand of the divine children -- those you now call your gods -- embracing you and pushing you towards their own goals. There is no shadow kin amongst you.'
7147:Tell them to get off their high horse and stop pretending the shadow kin have rules. Embracing darkness is all about letting go, after all.
7148:They may be right. You are one of the chosen now, walking the path of balance, not darkness. Ask them to consider it as a means of escaping their cursed fate.
7149:The shadow elf smiles, and it is an odd, twisted kind of grimace formed by muscles unused in decades.{}{}{}{}'Well, I have been told, indeed. So you need to get to the druid-tree, yes? The shadows told me this much.'
7150:'It has fallen deep into a chasm of pure darkness. There it lingers, resistant to the change, yet unable to be free. {}{}{}{}Even we do not go near it, although we could, of course.'
7151:[Shadow elf]What would it take to have them bring the druid-tree out for you, or just her blood?
7152:The shadow kin lie dead. You search the area and find a spot where heavy black mist hangs. On closer inspection, you do see roots of a large tree coming out of that spot. This is likely where the druid-tree lies. {}{}{}{}But you feel the intensity of the black mist grow, as if the conquered shadow kin have fed its power.
7153:Try to get to the tree.
7154:'I suppose we've had our fun. For you, it will not be so hard to get her, so we will help if you pay us. Have a look at what we seek. We'd like some medium armour, diamonds or jewellery, and if you have spirits bound to you, we could use some of those too.'
7155:Trade your spirit companions.
7156:The black mist engulfs you, and your worst fears and nightmares assail your souls till dread turns your bodies stiff.{}{}{}{}Some of you may not leave this place unchanged.
7157:The shadow elves lead you to where the druid-tree lies, engulfed in black mist.{}{}{}{}You are told it lies in a hole, and that it has no strength to climb out on its own.
7158:You strike the druid-tree through the heart and it bleeds - thick red blood tainted with specks of black.{}{}{}{}The tree slowly turns still, and you see its twisted face become serene.
7159:Take the blood and leave.
7160:You try to move the druid-tree out of the forest, but while its roots allow you to carry it a few feet, they will not extend any farther. When you try to force them, you see more pain on its face.
7161:As you go in closer, you are certain you must delve into the mist to retrieve the druid-tree's blood.
7162:Run in, grab the druid-tree, and run out. 
7163:The shadow kin frown at your violence and engulf you in the black mist from whence some of you may return changed. {}{}{}{}They depart this place.
7164:The dark mist is heavy and strains your spirit with every step. You walk a while and are met by a shadow elf:{}{}{}{}'What do you seek here, stranger? I sense some affinity to change and dark mists of magic upon you, yet you are not one of us.'
7165:The shadow elf frowns:{}{}{}{}'Well, as I said, not one of us. What is it that brings you here, stranger?'
7166:There is nothing of interest here.
7167:You return to where the druid-tree lies in black mist. The shadow elves you attacked previously are gone.{}{}
7168:Proceed to the tree.
7169:A group of hooded cultists stands on your path, and you realise they have surrounded you. While a few stand before you, many more lurk behind, and you hear them chanting.
7170:Ask them why they helped you.
7171:Tell them to step away and leave.
7172:'You seek to undo what we achieved, yet what we did was not what we intended, so are we foes, or allies bound by common misfortune and the cruel jest played by the divine upon our intentions?'
7173:??
7174:Is he saying they are the ones responsible for the broken heart and the Shattering? If so, how?
7175:Tell them you have no time or willingness to listen to long tales. Cut to the chase.
7176:'Your puzzled face gives me pause, for I assumed the champion would be told more, but then did we also perhaps gag the divine voice, once again making them puppeteers in their own game? Perhaps, likely yes. Still, what are we to do now when our victory is about to be undone by you, or else you by it?'
7177:Puppeteers? Weakened? What does he mean?
7178:'You, you are champions of Nyia, thus proving we were ultimately not so. But did she trick us? Or were we the ones who unwittingly folded her plans, or were we tools in some other hand? Tell us, please?'
7179:Tell them they were misguided, cheated by elven fanatics who sought to bring the rule of light. Nyia was their tool.
7180:Say they were made fools because they are idiots. Nyia would never accept such incompetence, and they were arrogant to think otherwise.
7181:'Long, long ago we dreamt of a trapped goddess. A servant of Veles, the old god of the underworlds, but unwanted and left in the darkness, left alone to perish. Her heart was empty, a dark hole, a void so sad. It called to us and we answered. We stole another heart to give to her. {}{}{}{}Sadly, she did not want it, for she was already woken when we came with our gift. She did not even look at us.'
7182:What goddess?
7183:Have you got the old heart? 
7184:'Nyia is her name. If you don't know it yet, that is because she does not like to be known. We will say no more.'
7185:'We took the stone heart from deep, deep in the earth. We used relics of many folk, and a holy hog given by your gods was our main sacrifice -- its blood, blessed as it was, had a lot of light in it and thus broke the seals.'
7186:And then?
7187:'We broke sacred seals to take the earth-heart from the ground. It was for a goddess who did not want it. We were tricked by someone.{}{}{}{}Then the earth shook and shook and shook and light came and with it a beast, too much light! You now have the blood and the mad runemaster who can carve you another heart, but it will cost you. Still you must do it, for the light is getting stronger!'
7188:There is a creature of light where the heart was and it grows stronger. Do you know more?
7189:'Then the earth shook and shook and shook and light came, too much light! And our goddess does not even know us. She is angered by our deeds, so our kin cannot ever know the peace of dying till this is resolved.'
7190:So what exactly do they want or not want you to do here?
7191:'Nothing, everything, who knows? We come to repent and tell you of the light that sits in the hole we once robbed. It grew, it fed, it feeds still. {}{}{}{}With more light, more will be taken until all is one, all is stale and still, but they do not understand that life will end if it is so. We need still and unstill. The dark is not bad, the light is not good, they are.'
7192:'No, ask wise folk, but beware of elder forest folk. They are born of light, and they say they serve harmony and balance - but do they?' 
7193:Any other suggestions?
7194:'Ah, no, no, we do not have it because she did not want it, so we left it and then it was gone. Taken, maybe? We smelled elves, but why would they take it? We do not know more - ask them.'
7195:So what do they want from you?
7196:How did they take the earth-heart? 
7197:'The tree burnt once and gods were damaged, then we made the earth shake and maybe did damage again? Else, where did the old ones go?'
7198:The earth parts and you are stunned by a ray of bright, burning light. From within the gash you see figures climbing out and rushing towards you while you try to get your bearings after the flash.{}{}
7199:Stand firm and brace for combat.
7200:'Give back the blood.'{}{}{}{}The many voices, yet one voice, chant as the figures swarm you. But just as you are about to be overwhelmed, hooded figures attack the lightbringers from the flank, giving you space to fight back.
7201:[Magic user]Attack with your spirit!
7202:The lightbringers lie defeated, their host bodies burnt to white ash.{}{}{}{}But you are not alone.
7203:Look for the hooded helpers.
7204:One of you is taken by the light and you barely escape. The lightbringers take the blood with them too. 
7205:'A child of light seeking to burn us - how odd. Ever we thought they had no such balls. How funny. Our goddess rose despite it, or perhaps we did release her, since you walk as her champion? Matters not. We served, so we bow to you and leave now.'
7206:Nod and wish them well.
7207:'Yes, yes, you are correct, champion - you speak for her who is cold but wise. We bow to you. We leave and will learn to serve better.'{}{}{}{}They scatter into the shadows. 
7208:'Go ask the stone and metal folk, or maybe the greenskins or their big kin that do not like to be called so. They are not so old, but they know darkness, so perhaps they will know this light too. Or take the blood you have and do the deed you must, whatever price you must pay, yes, yes . . . Now we leave, and you must go.'
7209:Nod in thanks for the help and leave.
7210:You enter the dwarven tomb where you hope to find the guardians. As you walk down the long, dark stone corridor, you feel this ancient place slowly come to life. {}{}{}{}Oil lamps begin to flicker and guide your path, and the gentle hum of old mechanisms beckons you towards the central chamber.
7211:You enter the great chamber where four statues of the heroes of old stand looming over you. One of them speaks as soon as you enter:{}{}{}{}'We waited a long time for one to come to punish our failure. Are you it?'
7212:Ask them how they failed to protect the heart. They don't look broken, and the chamber where the heart was is not here, right?
7213:Say that they can help now by giving up their lives for the making of a new heart.
7214:'This chamber was once the only way to get into the earth's chest, no matter where you entered or what other path you thought you found.{}{}{}{}But when the giants woke, the earth shifted and some blasted traitors took advantage! They snuck in, circumvented us, and broke the heart right under our noses. There was nothing we could do. Nothing . . .'
7215:'If only we could. We stand here, animated, but we are spirits of stone and metal. We endure, we stand guard, but we cannot forfeit our lives even if it was what we desired, chosen of the young gods.{}{}{}{}You do what you must. You do what needs doing!'
7216:[Magic user]If they are spirits, you can defeat them in a mystical battle. Attack!
7217:[Runemaster]Tell them their oaths demand obedience to the runemasters. Command them to stand down and give up their life essence to honour the stone code!
7218:[Light]Ask the ancient heroes to do the right thing. This is an affront to true Light, and as servants of the domain, you must all do your part!
7219:[Intellect]In the name of intellect, point out that their duty can only be done if they concede peacefully and aid your quest.
7220:'Thank you . . . go, make it right . . .'{}{}{}{}The stone and metal statues crumble, and you collect the translucent ash for the grandmaster. 
7221:'Come again when you are ready, lassies!'{}{}{}{}One of you is turned to stone as you run out of the tomb.
7222:They bow before you:{}{}{}{}'Thank you . . . go, make it right . . .'{}{}{}{}The stone and metal statues crumble, and you collect the translucent ash for the grandmaster. 
7223:'Aye, you speak with the vigour of the young gods, and although they are not our deities, we honour their wisdom and stewardship over the land. {}{}{}{}We willingly concede and give our life force for the making of a new earth-heart. Perhaps this was always our fate.'
7224:Bow in honour of their sacrifice.
7225:You find the cave where the earth's chest lies, and it is much brighter than you expected.{}{}{}{}The dazzling shine blinds you at first, and even after a time, you still feel dizzy from it. When you enter the final chamber, you see the torn corpse of a zmey, animated by living rays of pulsating light energy brighter than any lightbringer you've seen so far.
7226:Look around for the Alchemist with the heart.
7227:Look for the dwarves and the ice heart.
7228:Look around for the necromancer who promised to help.
7229:Look around for the elves.
7230:The Alchemist stands before you:{}{}{}{}'Here, the heart was forged at the greatest of prices. You see how even now it sucks in some of the light. This creature will be weakened now. Go, deal with it.'{}{}
7231:Approach the light-beast.
7232:As you come closer, you hear waves of voices, thousands perhaps, but they all speak in unnerving unison. One leads them and turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Come, join. Be at ease. Cleansed from darkness for good. We will stay till the end of days. Peace, tranquillity. Come.'
7233:[Light and Harmony]Call out to this tortured creature, call upon your domain and demand it ceases its madness. Light is supposed to be harmony, balance, order -- not this!
7234:[Magic user]Attack it with spirit!
7235:Ask what it seeks, why it takes people. Is there an end goal?
7236:The light-beast is slain and its body incinerates into white ash. Bright flares explode in all directions, blinding you for a second, but they are quickly sucked in by the heart held by the Alchemist.{}{}{}{}He hands you the stone relic, and you place it on a carved pedestal that resembles a huge ribcage. 
7237:Wait to see what happens next.
7238:The ribcage vibrates, then slowly it closes to hold its new heart. Blood-filled veins begin to pump through the stone and a slow heartbeat begins its rhythm. {}{}{}{}Thin rays of light trickle in from the walls and ceiling. It will likely take decades for all the excess light to be drawn here, but it should happen.
7239:Ask the Alchemist what happens now.
7240:'You did it! You found a way to stop the Shattering and push back the lightbringers. This chamber will hide itself, just as the cosmic tree does. The gods can now focus on restoring the land. {}{}{}{}I suppose I am done too, really. An odd thing, to be done with things.'
7241:Thank him for the help and depart.
7242:The Alchemist stands before you:{}{}{}{}'Here, the heart was forged with compassion, and thus surely worth it. But beware, the beast will not be weakened by it.'{}{}
7243:The light-beast devours you whole and threatens to tear up your soul with its scorching light. Slowly it feels so safe, warm, tranquil . . .{}{}{}{}Your divine connection shields you just in time to escape, but not everyone was so lucky.
7244:'Yes, yes, I see no reason not to. Let us go master this land and its dangers, for banishing the light-beast will surely not be the last of our endeavours. Lead on!'
7245:Thank him for the help and depart together.
7246:'We . . . we feel your intent, so strong. Balance? That is what you seek. We seek peace, tranquillity for all. But there is too much turmoil and darkness, and the more we push, the more it answers.{}{}{}{}We will listen to your guidance and allow you to restore the heart. Be well, be at peace.'
7247:Bow in thanks and say they made the right choice.
7248:The light-beast collapses and the energy dissolves slowly. Bright flares explode in all directions, blinding you for a second, but they are quickly sucked in by the heart held by the Alchemist.{}{}{}{}He hands you the stone relic, and you place it on a carved pedestal that resembles a huge ribcage. 
7249:'We seek no end, for there is no end or beginning, only light that unites all. When all is still, all is quiet and tranquil, we will be, forever.'
7250:From the shadows, the necromancer comes out with several minions:{}{}{}{}'Good, you kept your cool and now we can right many wrongs and have a world that is ours, not one dictated by old laws. Let us face this light-beast together.'
7251:You see him approach.
7252:[Turmoil and Magic]Draw strength from the heart of darkness you carry and make this light cower before you! Make it think you aim to trap it again and threaten destruction if it does not yield.
7253:'We . . . we feel your dark power. We cannot allow light to perish. We will surrender to the prison once more.'{}{}{}{}The light releases the carcass of the zmey host and seeps into the hole it came from without realising its impending doom.
7254:The necromancer urges you to place the heart of darkness onto a carved pedestal that resembles a huge ribcage. 
7255:As the ribcage closes, the dark heart begins to pump its corrupted blood through black veins that now cover the entire cave. The rhythm is uneven and rushed. The Alchemist cries out:{}{}{}{}'What, why? Why choose darkness? I promised I would follow you, but now my job is done. I leave you to your dark work and new friends.' He shoots a dirty look toward the necromancer and departs. 
7256:Ask the necromancer what happens now.
7257:'Who can say for sure? With darkness comes change and uncertainty. But the lightbringers should suffer now, and in time the Shattering should cease. That was our goal, yes?'
7258:'Yes, I shall, for you are interesting.'
7259:The beast lies defeated. The light releases the carcass of the zmey host and seeps into the hole it came from without realising its impending doom.
7260:Take out the heart of the mroki.
7261:You see them approach.
7262:The emissaries appear, holding a wooden box:{}{}{}{}'This is the new heart. We will place it within the stone chest, but you must defeat the light-beast for us. It will be weakened now, but you must act fast.'
7263:The light-beast is slain and its body incinerates into white ash. Bright flares explode in all directions, blinding you for a second, but they are quickly sucked in by the heart held by the elves. They place it on a carved pedestal that resembles a huge ribcage. {}{}{}{}But you also see more light drained from the elder kin, and some collapse from the strain.
7264:Turn to Nai-ysir to see if she is okay.
7265:Ask the Alchemist and the elves what happens now.
7266:Nai-ysir nods, but you see the terror on her face as her kin fall one by one:{}{}{}{}'I . . . I was likely protected by proximity to you and your gods. Let us just finish this, please.'
7267:The elves do not speak, but the Alchemist turns to you:{}{}{}{}'The price was high, but fair. The lightbringers should be weakened straight away, and in time, the Shattering should subside. For now, you've done it. Let us leave this place and allow the elves their space.'
7268:Nod. Ask if he will stay with you.
7269:'Well, I would, but I am inclined to go help whatever elf kin is yet alive. You see, my alchemy can cleanse some of the taint, or at least I want to try.'{}{}{}{}
7270:Wish him good luck and depart.
7271:'Yes, I will accompany you, at least for a time.'{}{}
7272:Thank them for taking this path.
7273:Belze'dhur appears and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ya did well laddie! Now, let us go kick some Light-Zmey arse and get this here heart in place.'{}{}
7274:The light-beast is slain and its body incinerates into white ash. Bright flares explode in all directions, blinding you for a second, but they are quickly sucked in by the ice heart held by the Alchemist.{}{}{}{}He hands you the ice relic, and you place it on a carved pedestal that resembles a huge ribcage. 
7275:Turn to the dwarves.
7276:'Aye, good deed. Repairin' our shameful failure, that's waht ya did. Stone and metal be with ya always.'
7277:Ask the Alchemist to join.
7278:Ask the dwarf to join.
7279:'Aya, don't mind if I do, laddie. Let's go.'
7280:'Well, hello there, chosen - welcome into the service of the gods. As a believer myself, I am happy to be the one to guide you.'
7281:Ask who he is, exactly?
7282:Tell him to beat it. You may be chosen, but you care little for all this talk! [Skip Story]
7283:'Theodore's the name. But little old me is not relevant here. YOU are. {}{}{}{}I am here to tell you of some basic rules and hand over any divine objects that may have been bestowed upon you. First and foremost, the cosmic seed.'
7284:Cosmic seed?
7285:'Yes. Thea is far from a land of prosperity. Darkness was defeated long ago, but it is not gone. It lurks in the corners and attacks at night. {}{}{}{}The Shattering tears the earth asunder and a scorching light takes hold of folk without protection.'
7286:How does it relate to the seed?
7287:'The seed, and others like it, is a gift of the divine. A piece of the cosmic tree itself. It can grant great boons. It allows you to set up a village and provide divine protection there.{}{}{}{}But if you wish for the life of a traveller, or if you are skilled enough to create another seed one day, this seed can be used to forge divine artefacts or even bring back a comrade from the clutches of death!'
7288:So one cannot build villages without a seed? 
7289:'Indeed - you catch on fast! Without the seed, or different means that other factions may possess, a village attracts the cursed light and is taken by it within days. And if somehow that does not happen, terrors of darkness will drive your folk insane. {}{}{}{}This is how it has been in Thea for many centuries now. It is why we struggle still to survive just another day.'
7290:Ask if there is anything else you need to know?
7291:'I may pop up now and again to tell you of things, but for now, you must take your first steps into this hostile land. {}{}{}{}Remember to check for resources on the map for Gathering, set up camp for Craft and Cooking, and check your Inventory to make sure you are well equipped. Here have some wood, so you may heal when camping.{}{}{}{}My advice is to explore, learn the ropes, and only then decide on a settlement.'{}{}
7292:Thank him for the advice and leave.
7293:'All right, all right. Just remember, without the cosmic seed - a special divine artefact - you cannot build a village. You are bestowed one now and may try to gain another later, but they will never be plentiful. So take care where you choose to settle! {}{}{}{}And if you do not want to build a village, you may use the seed to craft a special object or resurrect a fallen friend. Now go, explore and conquer.'
7294:You catch the lightbringers who took the druid-blood and one of your people!
7295:[Magic users]Attack with spirit!
7296:[Hunter]You quickly recognise this area as the old dark-swamps. A place where pockets of darkness linger. Try to lead them into a trap there.
7297:[Turmoil or Magic]You sense the presence of darkness here, hidden pockets that lurk in the corners. Bait the lightbringers into a trap!
7298:You defeat the lightbringers, and your connection to the divine releases your friend from the light's hold. You also recover the druid-blood.
7299:The lightbringers overwhelm you, and you barely escape.
7300:The lightbringers fall for your trap and are caught by the hidden darkness, making them easy to kill while they struggle. Your connection to the divine releases your friend from the light's hold. You also recover the druid-blood.
7301:You track down a group of mroki. Perhaps you can harvest their hearts for the necromancer.
7302:[Magic user]Defeat them with spirit!
7303:You defeat the mroki, and this time you are able to harvest a heart and store it in a bone casing given to you by the necromancer. {}{}{}{}You can now head to the red cave and find your way into the chamber where the light-beast awaits.
7304:The mroki defeat you, and the darkness drains your souls before you escape.
7305:'Oh, it's you, come, come,  you see how big we are now, all thanks to you.''
7306:Say that you just came to rest and visit.
7307:Ask if you can visit the slave trade.
7308:Someone is calling out to you. Go see what they want.
7309:'You beat it or we beat you, scum!'{}{}{}{}You see armed folk gathering.
7310:Say that you mean them no harm. You only want to talk and visit.
7311:'Some damned crows sit in a tower nearby. They keep botherin' us and we ain't got the time to get 'em. You deal with it, if ya want.'
7312:'I suppose you can rest.{}{}{}{}We have us some wise ones here. If they're not busy, they're good with the body and the mind.'
7313:One of the scavengers is said to be dying of mind rot, and everyone gathers to listen to their dying tales. They sound like a lot of gibberish, but folk seem convinced it is worthwhile. Listen with them.
7314:'There's always trouble about the place. There's a nice rich patch of ruins nearby, but stupid bees have set up there. We're small, only setting up, so if you'll help us get them bees, we'll be friends, for sure.'
7315:You see they are in need of stone. Tell them you're willing to give away some of yours.
7316:'Bastard Slavyans set up a settlement near us. Soon they'll come knockin' on our doorstep, sayin' godly stuff and forcin' us to listen. Get rid of them lot and we'll be mates for sure.'
7317:'A witch, that's what you're after, eh?{}{}Magic comes at a price. Healing the spirit is easier. Curses -- well, they are nasty things, and they'll cost you more. Cost you blood.'
7318:Agree to pay the price.
7319:The witch says, 'Bah, should've said so, sis. I wouldn't have tried to sell you the price crap, ha. Let's get to it.'{}{}{}{}Together, you remove any curses you had.{}{}
7320:'You weird, you are. But sure, thanks.{}{}{}{}We cannot give much in return 'cause we ain't as odd as you, but here, have what we can spare.'
7321:'Sure thing, let's deal, we may have some live'uns for ya. And don't go lookin' at us like that, we never said we don't do slavery, just that we didn't like them bandits doing it to us.'{}{}
7322:Buy a slave.
7323:'There's always trouble about the place. Some slimy gobbos set up camp nearby. You deal with them, we be friends for sure.'
7324:'Bah, fine, you look honest enough and you carry the mark of the gods. We best not anger them lot. {}{}{}{}Come in, but we're watching you!'
7325:'Beat it!'
7326:'Good trading with you. Now bugger off.'
7327:You come to the place where the scavengers said a beehive is bothering them.
7328:You have folk who know how to deal with bees. Consider your options.
7329:[Wisdom]You know a bit about bees, so think of a way to deal with them.
7330:Use your food to lure the bees away from the territory and hope they won't come back.
7331:You get in closer so you can assess the situation.
7332:[Bee]Buzz up to the hive and tell them to leave.
7333:Try to communicate with the bees.
7334:Bees dislike smoke. Figure out the best place to smoke them out safely.
7335:Kill the bees in an easy fight because you know the enemy. [Physical]
7336:You could try to use some thick smoke with poisoned poppy seeds. That will suffocate the bees slowly, but it should get rid of them.{}{}{}{}However, if things go wrong, they will get very angry.
7337:Yes, kill them one by one.
7338:You buzz about with the other bees and convince them that this area is not safe.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow. {}{}
7339:The smoke works, but slowly, so you are stung by some angry survivors before the hive dies.{}{}
7340:You find just the right spot and use just the right amount of smoke to get rid of the problem. The bees buzz off and the scavengers should be happy now.{}{}
7341:You give the food away and lead the bees to another spot. 
7342:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you find out that the bees returned to their spot and continued to harass the settlers. They have to deal with the bees themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
7343:You are unconvincing, and the bees stay.
7344:Just attack them. [Physical]
7345:You fail and the bees go crazy on you!{}{}{}{}The folk who asked for your help hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the wolves themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7346:The bees listen to reason and decide to relocate. You dealt with the problem as asked, so you gain friendship.
7347:A single bee buzzes with friendship for you and stays.
7348:The scavengers hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the bees themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7349:You buzz with the other bees and try to tell them it isn't safe here, but they are angered by your presence and attack!{}{}
7350:Defend yourself.
7351:You find the Slavyan camp that the scavengers asked you to deal with.
7352:Convince the Slavyans that the scavengers aren't worth the trouble and that it would be best to leave.
7353:[Intellect or Harmony]Convince the Slavyans that fighting is not the way to go here. A truce may prove safer and more profitable for both.
7354:Pay the scouts.
7355:Attack.
7356:[Hunter or perception]These Slavyans seem determined to hunt for scavengers, so plant false tracks to lead them away from this piece of land.
7357:'We thank you, friend, for you saved us time. We Slavyan folk should stick together against those godless types. Good luck to you.'
7358:Wish them well and leave to report your success.
7359:As the Slavyans move away, they leave you a gift.
7360:'You speak for gods, so we will listen. We will make peace.'
7361:Leave and report your success.
7362:You are about to report your success when you learn that the Slavyans lied to you and continue to pester the scavengers. {}{}{}{}Your friendship suffers for it.
7363:You are defeated and eventually the scavengers deal with the problem themselves, so you do not gain any friendship.
7364:You fail to fool the Slavyans. They don't look too impressed with you.
7365:Pay them for this insult and to leave this land.
7366:Leave and admit defeat.
7367:Your misdirection works, and the Slavyans move away.{}{}{}{}You dealt with the problem as asked, so you gain friendship.{}{}
7368:The scavengers hear of your failure. They have to kill the Slavyans themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7369:'You talk for the gods, sure, but we got to make a living. You pay us, we leave you and your friends in peace, deal?'
7370:The scavengers are furious:{}{}{}{}'What? Peace with them lot? Not likely and not what we asked for. You god folk, you all stick together -- begone!'
7371:You find the makeshift goblin settlement that the scavengers asked you to get rid of. 
7372:Go in closer to talk.
7373:[Magic or intellect]Goblins are known to respect your domain. Try to reason with them.
7374:Pay the greenskins to leave.
7375:The goblins stand with weapons at the ready:{}{}{}{}'What do you want here? This is our patch of spirit ground, we stay here.'
7376:[Goblin]Say that the hummies are being arseholes and want them gone. Ask if they can move along.
7377:Tell them the scavengers do not want them as neighbours. Ask them to relocate, now!
7378:Goblins don't usually go for bribery, but these guys look worse for wear, so they may accept resources. Ask them if they will leave for a price.
7379:You notice that a lot of the goblins are wounded from a previous fight and are trying to patch themselves up.{}{}{}{}You see a stream from which they are taking water. You could poison it. In this weakened state, they are bound to die painfully.
7380:Poison the stream.
7381:'Yeah, those soft-skin types, they always so touchy when it comes to turf. We will go, friend. We want no trouble, we had enough with some orcs not far from here, so beware!'{}{}
7382:Thank them for the warning and wish them luck.
7383:Offer to party together before they depart.
7384:The gobbos die horribly from the poison, but before the last one falls, he shakes his shaman staff and curses your honourless souls!
7385:Damned goblin. Take what you can from them.
7386:'I see, yes. You speak well, friend, and those gods of yours understand the mind and the spirit. We leave and give you this token of our friendship. Spirits be with you.'
7387:'Yeah, all right, deal's a deal, times are hard and stuff is good, so we move out.'
7388:You are about to report your success when you realise that the goblins have no honour -- they have returned.{}{}{}{}They are eventually beaten by the scavengers without your help, and your friendship suffers for it.
7389:'You think you scumbags can come and tell us what to do? Beat it or else!'
7390:'Ah, you, those hummies, this place seems to have bad mojo. We go.'{}{}{}{}You dealt with the problem as asked, so you gain friendship.{}{}
7391:The scavengers hear of your failure. They have to get rid of the goblins themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7392:'Yeah, you have good vibes, so we go as we said. May spirits be kind to you.'{}{}{}{}The gobbos move on and the scavengers are pleased. {}{}
7393:'Hmm, perhaps. Give us some worthwhile goods and we will leave, and we'll even trade with you on top of that, if you like.'
7394:'Ha! This land's good place, spirits speak well here. We do not leave, you can tell your friends that.'
7395:'Now you speak like a true spirit child. Come, let us smoke and dance!'
7396:Party till the morning.
7397:You party well. Afterward, the goblins keep to their word and leave.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are pleased with the result.{}{}
7398:You party well - too well for some. Afterward, the goblins keep to their word and leave.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are pleased with the result.{}{}
7399:The poison does its gruesome job and the scavengers should be happy that their problem is gone.{}{}
7400:You find the tower where a crow's nest is bothering the scavengers. 
7401:You know how to handle crows. Try to figure it out.
7402:[Hunter]Track the crows.
7403:[Crow]Dominate the crows.
7404:Crows like to collect shiny things. Try to bribe them to leave.
7405:You come closer and observe the birds, trying to find the best way to approach this. 
7406:[Crow]Fly with the crows and convince them that this is not a safe place for a nest, as the scavengers are determined to explore it. 
7407:You have those who can communicate with crows, so make them obey you.
7408:Set a trap for the crows and attack when they are weakened.
7409:Crows respect territory. Try to figure out a way to mark this land for the scavengers, thus making the crows leave.
7410:You stalk the crows and pick them out one by one, making the rest flee.{}{}
7411:You fly together and the crows listen to your wisdom and move away from the tower.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
7412:The crows try to fight back and leave you bleeding, but the job gets done. 
7413:You mark the territory and harass the crows for a time, so that in the end they move on from the tower.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
7414:The crows take their shiny trinkets and fly away.
7415:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the crows returned to their tower. The scavengers have to deal with the problem themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
7416:You are unconvincing, so the crows stay.
7417:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the crows.{}{}{}{}The scavengers hear of your failings and come to your aid. They have to kill the crows themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7418:The crows bow to your dominance and depart. Perhaps one or two may even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are happy with your work.{}{}
7419:The scavengers hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the crows themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
7420:The crows seem to listen to your wisdom at first, but later you discover they only moved their nest deeper into the tower, making it even more dangerous for the scavengers to loot this place.{}{}{}{}They are not impressed with you.{}{}
7421:The crows bow to your dominance and fly away. Perhaps one even decides to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are happy with your work.{}{}
7422:'I never do put much stock in mortal words, yet I have hoped for some semblance of integrity from the so called chosen. {}{}{}{}You either walk my path, or we stand now on opposite sides and must battle, for I detest treachery above all else.'{}{}
7423:Promise you will walk her path and go to the zmey cave right away.
7424:Say you would rather join the Alchemist and the dwarf. 
7425:'A poor choice, child!'{}{}{}{}She attacks and she is not alone!
7426:[Magic user] Attack with your spirit!
7427:You kill the mage and she turns into silver ash as she perishes.
7428:'I detest unnecessary death, so I shall only cripple you so you feel my displeasure at your treachery. {}{}{}{}I no longer feel you pests are worthy of light. I shall retreat and think on this. Goodbye, worms.'{}{}{}{}She walks off and your spirit burns.
7429:'Good, go seek the cave as I told you, I shall deal with your Alchemist friend.'
7430:'Welcome, chosen. I can't stay and chat, but I hear you are making progress in solving this whole Shattering business. {}{}{}{}I was sent to give you this and wish you luck. The gods watch over you, bye!'
7431:The fires are warm and the ale is good. The tavern is bustling with life and joy. 
7432:See if you can recruit anyone.
7433:[Demon]Do some gambling.
7434:Do some gambling.
7435:Drink.
7436:There are some folks here who may want to join your band, seeing as you are the chosen and all.
7437:Approach a warrior.
7438:Approach a hunter.
7439:There's a zerca staring at you. Ask him over.
7440:There's a bandit sitting in a corner. Approach him.
7441:Someone is ushering you over to speak to them. Go see what they want.
7442:There are no more folks who want to join this time. 
7443:No deal. Better luck next time. 
7444:A fighter is available but requires a payment.
7445:Pay them if you can.
7446:A hunter is available but requires a payment.
7447:He comes up to you and says he will follow you for free, as you are the chosen!
7448:They say they'll do mercenary work for the right price.
7449:An orphan overhears you recruiting and begs for you to take them in. They heard that you are a champion and they want to be one too, apparently.
7450:One should never try gambling with demons. You were made for trickery, after all. {}{}{}{}You win, but the folk look at you with suspicion.
7451:Time to go.
7452:Lady luck has smiled upon you again. You win.
7453:Who needs luck when you have the gods on your side? You win.
7454:Alas, luck was not on your side. You lost.
7455:You got so drunk, you don't recall much of what happened. But a stork visits you some time later . . .
7456:Good?
7457:Slavyans may be known for their drinking, but there simply isn't anyone with a tougher head than a Slavyan dwarf!{}{}{}{}You drink everyone under the table and impress the locals greatly.
7458:Great. Now it's time to leave.
7459:Slavyans may be known for their drinking, but you are a Slavyan too, after all, even if not from the same branch. So you drink with them hand in hand and they are impressed.
7460:The Slavyans sure do know how to drink. You do not recall the evening, but you feel its effects painfully . . .
7461:You got into a fight and discovered hidden strength within you. Unfortunately, the locals do not appreciate your prowess. You get kicked out of the tavern.
7462:Time to leave.
7463:'Say, you did us a solid and all, our witch will teach ya to be like her, warts and all, but also that dark magic stuff. It may kill ya, but your choice.'
7464:Yes, train one random scavenger to become a magic user.
7465:No, refuse and leave.
7466:Scavengers are only after stuff, give them some, perhaps you'll make friends.
7467:'Ah, you god-folk, good to see ya!'
7468:'Fine, fine, here, you take our shit and we back away. No need for fightin' and no hard feelings either, eh.'
7469:If they left anything of use take it and leave.
7470:You won.
7471:'Sure, you fool, but we don't care. Bye.'{}{}{}{}{}{}
7472:You sit down to have your evening meal.
7473:[Perception]Your food looks off. Better check it.
7474:Enjoy your food.
7475:You realise that your food is laced with, well, the droppings of a small creature. {}{}{}{}You spot a small furry creature running away.{}{}
7476:Leopold? Screw that little bastard. Kill him!
7477:Leopold? Leave him be and go look for those demons so you can stop this silliness.
7478:You realise too late that your food was laced with, well, the droppings of a small creature. {}{}{}{}You feel ill. You also find some brown fur. Leopold?{}{}{}{}
7479:Shake your fist in the air and swear at the demons.
7480:Remain calm and leave. Perhaps you should track down the demons Leopold told you about so he stops these tricks.
7481:You killed the demon and as it dies, it exerts a green gooish phlegm that spreads all over you and causes you to gag and likely get ill. 
7482:You lost with a skshack...{}{}{}{}It stares at you in disbelief, laughs, throws up all over you with green gooish phlegm that spreads all over you and causes you to gag and likely get ill.{}{}{}{}As you swear at it, the creature shows the middle finger, but not to you, to someone or something up in the skies. Then it runs off.  
7483:You get the sense you just scored someone some points.
7484:'Now that you have had a little time to get your bearings, how about doing me and your gods a bit of a favour, eh?{}{}{}{}You'd have to go to a place and deal with some trouble.'{}{}
7485:Sure, listen.
7486:An important task? Yes, accept it now. [Skip story]
7487:'As you remember, to set up your first village you will need to find the right spot and gather materials. Or you can just choose the life of a wanderer. {}{}{}{}But either way, there will come a time when the gods ask you to do battle, to solve the Shattering's mystery.'{}{}
7488:And what are you to do till then?
7489:'For now, your job is to live long enough to face those challenges. Not very glamorous, I know.{}{}{}{}But listen, there is a small village of Slavyans not far from here. I ask you to seek them out and help them out of their troubles if you so wish.'{}{}
7490:What sort of help?
7491:'A final rest from their heresy is not out of the question, but a peaceful resolution would suit us just as well. Your choice.'
7492:Heresy?
7493:'Let us just say they do not follow the path of the gods but have strayed into the arms of fallacy. {}{}{}{}Now, typically, our gods do not care. But the culprit was a chosen, like you. Thus, it is a case of teaching one a lesson.'{}{}
7494:Teaching them, or you?
7495:Accept this task.
7496:He only smiles. 
7497:'Well met, friends, now that Zbigniev is no longer troubling you or us, we can welcome you properly.'
7498:The tavern is open, visit it.
7499:Visit the food trader.
7500:'You best move along. You're no friends of ours.'{}{}{}{}You see armed folk gathering.
7501:'Sure, go right ahead, we may have some pups for you to buy, or we may have something more exotic. It's a one off, for helping us.'{}{}
7502:Buy a trained spider, to aid you in a fight.
7503:Buy a cat, it will help with mystical matters and give some mental soothing.
7504:You come to a small village, and despite the calm weather outside, you see storm clouds hanging over this settlement and lightning dancing threateningly around the palisade.
7505:[Stribog]Ask your lord to calm this storm so you may enter in peace.
7506:[Chosen]You feel that this storm will not harm you, so enter.
7507:Barge in and ask where exactly is this chosen who defied gods. [Skip Story]
7508:As you walk in confidently, you see several scared faces looking out of their windows at you. Finally, a small group of villagers comes out to face you:{}{}{}{}'The storm, it listens to you. It seems not to touch you. How?'{}{}
7509:Call out Stribog's name. Tell them the gods are displeased and you have come on their behalf.
7510:Say that the god of the winds protects you. Ask them if perhaps they have angered the gods lately
7511:'Oh, that. It's not our fault. It's that fool, Zbigniev. He is chosen too, you see, so we listened, and he said the light is good and we must worship it harder than the old gods. He said Svarog was a fool that cannot tame his own domain. And that worshipping Magic and Turmoil was evil.{}{}{}{}We listened?'{}{}
7512:Where is this Zbigniev now?
7513:No wonder they are cursed. Show them the wrath of the gods - attack!
7514:[Svarog]How dare they even say this? Were it not for the master of light and home fires, they would be cold and the dark night would return!
7515:[Turmoil or Magic]They are clearly ignorant fools. Your domain does embrace darkness, but only to an extent, to keep balance within the pantheon.
7516:[Zorya]They offend your lady's father! Die!
7517:[Intellect, Light, Nature or Harmony]The emergence of this light is worrying and it is most certainly not of divine origin. It must have twisted their chosen. Where is he now?
7518:'He has gone to fetch the lightbringers here. He says it will save us. We begged him not to. But we cannot leave, for everyone who tries gets hit by lightning. {}{}{}{}It is as if the gods want us to die here?'{}{}
7519:Yes, they do. Attack!
7520:Ask them to tell you where to look for Zbigniev. Perhaps if you deal with him, they will be spared.
7521:'Well, I don't know. We listened to a chosen one once before?'
7522:Convince them that they must, for their own sake and that of the gods.
7523:'Your logic is sound, chosen. We will not fail the gods again. Here, this is where he went.'{}{}{}{}They hide back in their houses and point in the direction where they last saw Zbigniev.{}{}
7524:As you walk in confidently, you see several scared faces looking out of their windows at you. Finally, a small group of villagers comes out to face you:{}{}{}{}'The storm, it seems not to touch you. How?'{}{}
7525:Say that you are chosen. Tell them the gods are displeased and you have come on their behalf.
7526:Tell them the gods watch over you. Ask them if perhaps they have angered the gods lately.
7527:They cower before your anger, but one of them remains defiant despite it all:{}{}{}{}'He was once the master of sun itself. Light should be his plaything. Instead, it comes and tells us it will make us safe and at peace, while your god throws tantrums at our feet!'{}{}
7528:Slap him and say he'd better not speak ill of the gods again in your presence.
7529:Nod and say that you know full well the games gods play with their chosen and their kin, but both you and they are fated to play along or perish. Ask where this Zbigniev is.
7530:Say that you are not here to debate divine philosophy with them, but to resolve this issue. Where is this Zbigniev?
7531:They cower before your anger, but one of them remains defiant despite it all:{}{}{}{}'We are simple folk and do not understand this balance of yours. Darkness was bad, light is good. We followed it because our chosen said so. It made sense.'{}{}
7532:Fools. Show them what wrath of the gods really means, attack!
7533:Say that you are not interested in their excuses, where is this Zbigniev?
7534:The man raises his hand to retaliate, but he is grabbed by the others:{}{}{}{}'Let us not add to our perils, Leszko. And you, just leave us be.'{}{}
7535:Ask where you can find Zbigniev.
7536:Leave us be!
7537:You destroy the village and the storm lessens.{}{}{}{}Those who were left alive run away, relieved they can leave this place now. Some even thank you as they depart.{}{}
7538:Tell them they best not anger the gods again!
7539:'Well done, chosen. This should teach them a lesson to be sure. {}{}{}{}Now, of course this means you made some enemies, and you will not be able to trade with them or heal in their medicine huts and so on. Still, fate is yours to command.'{}{}
7540:'Now that you have destroyed the heretics, I advise you stay vigilant for any of their friends. {}{}{}{}That is all from me for now. The gods will call upon you again soon enough. For now, try to stay alive!'{}{}
7541:You are defeated and chased away.
7542:They cower before your anger, but one of them remains defiant despite it all:{}{}{}{}'We are simple folk. We do not understand much, but light should be good, this we know. Your words are so cold, just like Zbigniev said.'{}{}
7543:'We said, leave!'
7544:Try to convince them to tell you where Zbigniev is. Tell them this is divine business. 
7545:'Please go look for Zbigniev, we cannot live here normally until the gods are happy, we understand it now.'
7546:You track down Zbigniev, the heretic chosen who angered his gods. He spots you and speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Oh, a new chosen. Come to smite me, have you?'{}{}
7547:Admit that it is one of the leading options.
7548:'You're honest, good. Let me tell you, though, your puny gods can suck it. I've had enough.'
7549:He sounds really angry and the gods also seem unusually involved. What exactly did he do? 
7550:Tell him to stop swearing at your gods or you will have to 'smite' him. 
7551:'I stopped. I was fed up with doing their dirty work. I lived my life and then when light came knocking, I answered, because I like their side better.'
7552:Nod and say you will not harm him, for you believe it is not your place to interfere with the course of fate.
7553:Tell him he is weak and worthless and the gods have no time for such vermin. An example needs to be set. Kill him!
7554:Tell him you can soothe his broken soul, for clearly he has suffered and lost his way. Ask him to allow you to guide him back into divine light.
7555:Zbigniev leaves, but he looks less sure of himself.  Theodore appears:{}{}{}{}'Nature and Intellect, ever the sober companions. You are right that your deity would not wish for you to simply obey, for if the gods were to smite all who stray, well, there would be no lightning left.'{}{}
7556:Nod and ask if it was a test for you all along?
7557:Zbigniev leaves, but he laughs in your face. Theodore appears:{}{} {}{}'An interesting choice, doing nothing. Hmm. I am not convinced the gods had this in mind when they sent you, but who am I to know? {}{}{}{}Now, I leave you to your own devices, and the gods will surely call upon your services again. But for now, please stay alive.'{}{}
7558:'Indeed. Although confronting Zbigniev was needed for other reasons too. Many stoves burn in our divine kitchens, my darlings.{}{}{}{}Now, I leave you to your own devices, and the gods will surely call upon your services again. But for now, please stay alive.'{}{}
7559:Zbigniev was surprisingly weak, so you kill him without trouble. Theodore appears:{}{}{}{}'Turmoil and Light are aligned in this. Those who seek to follow the unnatural path of the lightbringers must surely be destroyed, especially if they were once chosen. Examples need to be made.'{}{}
7560:Zbigniev was surprisingly weak, so you kill him without trouble. Theodore appears: {}{}{}{}'Well, that was always my number one choice, but was it really what your god wanted? A question to ponder.{}{}{}{}Now, I leave you to your own devices, and the gods will surely call upon your services again. But for now, please stay alive.'{}{}
7561:Zbigniev drops to the floor and swears he will do better. He leaves for the village. Theodore appears:{}{}{}{}'Magic and Harmony calling out for the light of the gods to shine upon this wretched soul. Well done. This is surely the best way to show the power of the gods, eh?'{}{}
7562:Zbigniev leaves, but he laughs in your face. Theodore appears: {}{}{}{}'Well, that was always my number one choice, but was it really what your god wanted? A question to ponder.{}{}{}{}Now, I leave you to your own devices, and the gods will surely call upon your services again. But for now, please stay alive.'{}{}
7563:'Get off your mighty horse! You wanna know how a chosen ends up here? I stopped. I was fed up with doing their dirty work. I lived my life and then when light came knocking, I answered, because I like their side better.'
7564:'So, as tradition has it, your gods sent me to guide your first steps on this new and bewildering island.{}{}{}{}To get us started, check what resources you have near you (there's a toggle right next to the mini map).'{}{}
7565:Tell him you get it now. Cook him some food, right? It will be done.
7566:'If you have food and wood, they are always good to stock up on. You need both to heal when camped, and you need a variety of foods to better heal your mental wounds and keep morale high.{}{}{}{}Oh, and do you know what it means that you are chosen?'
7567:Tell him that you do, so no need to remind you.
7568:'Good. Finally, my first task for you, cook or find me some more food please. To do it, set up camp and choose nice stone oven icon to Cook (later you can also craft high tier, 4+,  materials there), or the basket to Gather food from the land. {}{}{}{}This is making me hungry, so hurry up!'{}{}{}{}He disappears.
7569:'You are all followers of your deity, but your gods speak and act through the Chosen.{}{}{}{}They have a special bond, so if you die, that's it, your god loses power and game over. Now, ready for the task I have for you?'{}{}
7570:'Yummy, well done! And here, one must have a good drink too. Now, the same way you cooked, you can also Craft equipment and later buildings in your village. You can also Design recipes to see how they will turn out.'
7571:Say you know already: go check out an abandoned house.
7572:'And don't forget to spend your Research Points. You can see your research tree at the top right corner. {}{}{}{}So now that you have this sorted, I know of an abandoned house you can explore. Who knows what mysteries you will uncover there?{}{}{}{}Remember to check your inventory before you venture out!'{}{}
7573:'Oh, and if you make special food you need to save for something, or more likely, you gather good wood or better food and you do not want it eaten or burnt, make sure to exclude them. You will find a looking glass icon in your camp, on the top left side.'
7574:You find Theodore's abandoned house. It is nestled amongst some trees and looks rather old.
7575:You find Theodore's abandoned house. It is nestled amongst some trees and looks rather old.{}{}{}{}As soon as you take another step, you realise that all the chosen are pulled in with you.{}{}{}{}
7576:Inside, the place is surprisingly lived in and well taken care of. There is even a fireplace. {}{}                   You hear an old woman's voice croak at you:{}{}{}{}'Well, well, well, dinner guests. How splendid. Do come and stay. Forever. Ha ha!'{}{}
7577:There is no way out - the doors are gone. You will have to face this hag to escape.
7578:[Magic user or mysticism]Use your spirit to dispel this dark magic!
7579:[Intelligence]Use your mind to get out of this pickle.
7580:Try to convince her to let you go.
7581:You defeat the witch, and the hut changes back into an old, decrepit building. {}{}{}{}
7582:Gather any loot.
7583:Theodore appears:{}{}{}{}'Well done, well done indeed! As chosen, it is your job to stay alive. You must either dominate the lands or solve the Shattering's mystery, or else all is lost. And for that, you must live. {}{}{}{}I shall be back soon to give you a final task.'{}{}{}{}He disappears.{}{}
7584:You are defeated. But just as the hag is about to hurt you, Theodore appears and the house changes back into a ruin.
7585:Ask him how he did that?
7586:'God's messengers have their ways. So, you were beaten. Not so good, but you will learn, I am sure? or we are all doomed. {}{}{}{}As chosen, it is your job to stay alive. You must either dominate the lands or solve the Shattering's mystery, or else all is lost. And for that, you must live. {}{}{}{}I shall be back soon to give you a final task.'{}{}{}{}He disappears.{}{}
7587:The witch laughs:{}{}{}{}'Bah, you are nice. I won't eat you. In fact, here is a small gift before I go, chosen.'{}{}{}{}A package is left for you, and the hut changes back into an old, decrepit building. {}{}
7588:The witch laughs:{}{}{}{}'Bah, you are smart. I won't eat you. In fact, here is a small gift before I go, chosen.'{}{}{}{}A package is left for you, and the hut changes back into an old, decrepit building. 
7589:Proceed.
7590:You are woken at night by your own hysterical laughter. Every time you think it has stopped, you feel the tickles again, and they are getting worse each time!
7591:[Wisdom or perception]This is surely a demon's work. Try to spot it.
7592:You're tough. Stick it out.
7593:The creature is really fast and spills some kind of dust on you so you can't see it very well. But you do spot it and you think it may be a hahalek, a trickster demon that, among other things, likes to tickle their prey, sometimes to the death!
7594:[Wisdom]House demons like that typically take food as an offering. Throw it some and maybe it will stop.
7595:[Perception]Observe it.
7596:[Child]A tickle fight! Jump on the creature and tickle it back. This is so much fun.
7597:You notice the hahalek silently mimics your laughter and even your grimaces and gestures, as if this is what drives it. Perhaps if you stay still, it will become bored and leave.
7598:Focus your mind on something else and stay still. 
7599:Try something else.
7600:The hahalek jumps for the food and rushes off, leaving you worn out but safe.
7601:Go back to sleep.
7602:You stay perfectly still and manage to stop yourself from laughing, and the hahalek does get bored. It huffs and puffs and throws up its arms in disappointment, then leaves. {}{}{}{}Surprisingly, it also leaves a gift for you. Perhaps you impressed it with your wits.
7603:You stay perfectly still and manage to stop yourself from laughing at first, but it is too much. You burst out in hysterical fits and the hahalek seems to enjoy it greatly. {}{}{}{}Eventually, it leaves, but some of you feel ill from the encounter. 
7604:The hahalek mimics your every move and the tickle battle is on. Eventually, you both collapse, exhausted and possibly ill, but the demon seems very happy with you and may leave a gift. 
7605:You laugh and laugh and your stomachs hurt like all hells, but eventually, whatever this was stops. {}{}
7606:You laugh and laugh and your stomachs hurt like all hells. Eventually, whatever this was stops, but some of you feel ill afterward. 
7607:You wake at night to discover a skshack eating your supplies!
7608:Shoo it away!
7609:Theodore?
7610:Yes, yes. He is forced to play a demon game and you must go look for a friend to try and sort it out, or he will be forced to do tricks on you. [Skip Story]
7611:The creature spits out his food and almost chokes:{}{}{}{}'Shit, you scared me! I mean, I am so, so sorry for stealing your stuff. Wasn't my idea, swears!'{}{}
7612:Whose idea was it, then?
7613:The creature spits out his food and almost chokes:{}{}{}{}'No, no, no! Please don't. I mean, I am so, so sorry for stealing your stuff. Wasn't my idea, swears!'
7614:Kill it anyway.
7615:The creature spits out his food and almost chokes:{}{}{}{}'Shit, you scared me! And no, I am not him. I mean, he is my third cousin on Auntie Wilma's side, three times removed, mind you, but still. You godly types, you always say I am him - well, no, I am me! Leopold is the name.{}{}{}{}Also, I am so, so sorry for stealing your stuff. Wasn't my idea, swears!'{}{}
7616:'Aw, I . . . I am not allowed to say directly. Demon laws. But I can tell you this story of mine?'
7617:Fine, listen.
7618:No, not interested, leave.
7619:You kill the demon and as it dies, it expels a green, gooey phlegm that spreads all over you and causes you to gag and likely get ill. 
7620:You lost with a skshack . . .{}{}{}{}It stares at you in disbelief, laughs, and throws up all over you with green, gooey phlegm that spreads all over you and causes you to gag and likely get ill. As you swear at it, the creature shows the middle finger, but not to you - to someone or something up in the skies. Then it runs off. 
7621:'I was playing a game of Kurv with a couple of mates - a hochlick, a pineconette, and a tooth fairy fella.{}{}{}{}Well, you likely do not know this, but them tooth fairies, they're real bullies. So, me and Frix, the hochlick, we decided to, you know, teach the bully a lesson, beat him at the game well and good.' 
7622:He cheated?
7623:'Cheat is such a mortal word. When us demons play, it is more, uh - who cheats best. {}{}{}{}But yeah, we tried to cheat more, you could say, and together. Only things went wrong.'
7624:The bully found you out and made you steal things?
7625:'What? Him? Nah. Tooth fairies are only good for pullin' them teeth out, and I got plenty. That was not the real issue . . . Frix . . . But I can't . . .'{}{}{}{}The skshack starts to choke violently and puffs up.
7626:[Demon or wisdom]Calm him down. His demon binding doesn't let him talk about this Frix fella, so clearly, he's the issue. Ask him to tell you how one could get in on this game.
7627:[Pet Demon]Your pet demon tells you the skshack is cursed or bound by a strong pact. This is why it suffers so. The pet tells you to ask about joining this game, as that is how you will learn more information.
7628:Well, you feel for him, but what does it all have to do with you?
7629:'Well, you see, I am a pawn now, but those who play, I think you may be the target. So even if you kill me, you'll likely just get jinxed by them lot. And I can't say more. I am already spilling more beans than I should, and only 'cause he pissed me off, that . . .' {}{}{}{}He chokes again. {}{}{}{}'So you help me and I help you, I swears!'
7630:So how exactly will this affect you? More stealing demons?
7631:Kill this thing!
7632:'Yes, yes, you know how things work. A curse, a binding. Something. But I am afraid the game is the Kurv catcher, so you know, me and you, we're stuck in it, because someone pointed at you as their "mortal to play with." And only demons can go play . . .'
7633:[Demon or pet demon]Offer to go sort it out.
7634:How else can you sort this out?
7635:'Yeah, and worse, depending on how the games go. They'll want to make you angry, swear a lot, then they get points. So, making you sick, stealing from you, making you trip, step on nails -- all sorts. {}{}{}{}Anyway, can't say more, or the demon laws will burn my tongue.'
7636:So how can you sort this out?
7637:'Well, only a demon can enter the Kurv game, and even then, only one with an invite. {}{}{}{}I got me two mates who can get you in. One's a cmuch, so he's a shy fella, and it will take some skill to seek him out. The other, she's a dola. Not your typical sort to deal in games, but she knows things, so I am sure she can get you in.'
7638:Will he come with you, then?
7639:'Yes, yes, your companion there knows how things work. A curse, a binding. Something. But I am afraid the game is the Kurv catcher, so you know, me and you, we're stuck in it, because someone pointed at you as their "mortal to play with." And only demons can go play . . .'
7640:'Wish I could - bound by laws, you see. And if I happen to do nasty shit to you before we sort this out, I truly am sorry and please don't kill me!' {}{}{}{}A green fog appears around the skshack and he disappears, his face slightly panicked. But he leaves behind a map that has an inscription:{}{}{}{}'Choose one friend you will visit.'
7641:Choose the cmuch and leave.
7642:Choose the dola and leave.
7643:'Well, only a demon can enter the Kurv game, so we got that covered, but we still need an invite. {}{}{}{}I got me two mates who can get you in. One's a cmuch, so he's a shy fella, and it will take some skill to seek him out. The other, she's a dola. Not your typical sort to deal in games, but she knows things, so I am sure she can get you in.'
7644:'Yes, yes, exactly. Go play the game for me, but first get an invitation.'{}{}{}{}'Choose one friend you will visit.'
7645:Leopold's map leads you to an abandoned house. This is where the dola who may give you an invite to the Kurv game is supposed to dwell.
7646:[Demon or wisdom]Dola are friendly demons. Go in and call out to her.
7647:Go in carefully. 
7648:The dola demon is rare and often goes unseen, for she takes on the shapes of common pets. {}{}{}{}So when you see a black cat staring at you, you suspect it is her.
7649:Tell her of the skshack you met and the Kurv game that you need to get into.
7650:Kill the dola!
7651:'Ah, that silliness. Yes, I do know of it. But why should I aid you, or that notorious friend of mine who should not have participated in the first place? House demons playing cruel tricks for fun and gambling. The shame.' 
7652:[Demon]Yes, it is shameful to break demon laws. This is why you need to go there and sort them out.
7653:[Child]Look at her with those large, sad eyes.
7654:[Harmony]Dola are known to be guardian spirits and bringers of good fate. Isn't your own domain akin to her nature? 
7655:Implore her to aid you, for you may not have any other way than killing the poor skshack she calls friend.
7656:Say that you really want to help the skshack, and this game sounds awful anyway.
7657:You enter the house, and all you find is a black cat staring at you.
7658:Black cats are known witch familiars. Kill it!
7659:[Witch]This is neither a plain cat nor a witch's familiar. It must be the dola.
7660:[Animal kin]This is no ordinary cat. Perhaps this is the dola. Speak to it.
7661:Black cats are notoriously bad omens, so best stay cautious, but leave it be. 
7662:'What do you want of me, witch? I rarely consort with your dark kind.'
7663:Why not?
7664:'Your senses are keen. Why do you seek me out?'
7665:As soon as you attack the creature, you feel faint and find yourself assailed by magic.
7666:You fight against the magic that assailed you, but when you look around the house, the dola is gone. {}{}{}{}While a friendly dola is known to watch over children or bring good fortune, an angry one . . .{}{}
7667:You fight against the magic that assailed you, but when you look around the house, the dola is gone. {}{}{}{}While a friendly dola is known to watch over children or bring good fortune, an angry one . . .
7668:'You show restraint even though you clearly mistrust my form. So I will speak to you. Why do you seek me out?'
7669:'Many forms that I take are used by your dark magic, be it for servitude or rituals. I do not appreciate it. But we are not here to speak of it. Why do you seek me out?'
7670:'Your argument is sound, and it is my nature to help, which I am sure Leopold knew when he sent you here. I shall aid you, because someone should go and sort those fools out.'
7671:How can she get you in?
7672:'All you need is a demon really, so for you,  you will only need is this invitation.'  {}{}{}{}She hands you a bloody human tooth.{}{}{}{}'It will show you an entrance when the time for another game comes.'
7673:'I will briefly grant you my ability to shift form. This way, the demons will think you are one of my kind, so all you need is this invitation.' {}{}{}{}She hands you a bloody human tooth.{}{}{}{}'It will show you an entrance when the time for another game comes. And my enchantment will work when it needs to, no sooner.'
7674:'You dare threaten my friend's life and expect help? Begone, mortal fiend, and do not return.'{}{}{}{}While a friendly dola is known to watch over children or bring good fortune, an angry one . . .
7675:'Yes, one of our kind is best suited for this. I shall aid you, because someone should go and sort those fools out.'
7676:'Playing nasty tricks on children? I will not stand idly by, my dear. I shall aid you, because someone should go and sort those fools out.'
7677:'It is typically in my nature to help, and I am pretty sure Leopold sent you here just for that reason. However, I will not interfere on his behalf this time. He must learn to deal with his own mischief. {}{}{}{}Goodbye.'
7678:Leopold's map leads you to an abandoned house. This is where the dola who may give you an invite to the Kurv game is supposed to dwell, but it is empty. {}{}{}{}Perhaps she heard of Leopold's death.
7679:Leopold?!
7680:That's it. Kill him!
7681:'Ah, yeah, yeah, I did say . . . I can't help it . . . Please go sort the game out, please . . .'{}{}
7682:Tell him to bugger off before you decide to end it by killing him.
7683:Admit that you killed the dola, or tried to. It was an accident. 
7684:Say that you killed off the cmuch.
7685:Tell him the dola said he's on his own with this mess.
7686:'Yes, yes, I go. Bye.'
7687:'Well, okay then, I suppose I'll seeya around . . .'{}{}{}{}He disappears.{}{}
7688:'Aw, ouch. I . . . well, I am sure you did your best. So, you will go see my cmuch friend instead?'
7689:Yes. 
7690:Killed the cmuch too.
7691:'Great, great. Perhaps less of the killing thing, eh? ' 
7692:'All righty, then. Awkward, this. I suppose I'll seeya around . . .'{}{}{}{}He disappears.
7693:'Aw, ouch. I . . . well, I am sure you had no choice. So, you will go see my dola friend instead?'
7694:Killed the dola too.
7695:'Aw, ouch. I . . . bitchy much . . . So, you will go see my cmuch friend instead?'
7696:Killed the cmuch.
7697:Leopold's directions lead you to a small pond. This is where the ever-elusive cmuch lives. {}{}{}{}From what Leopold said, finding his friend will be the challenge here.
7698:[Demon or perception]Cmuch are attuned to suffering. If you hurt yourself and try to make it look and feel real, it may come to you.
7699:[Cmuch]Your cmuch companion knows all the hideouts. Follow them.
7700:Go in carefully and search for the cmuch.
7701:Something moves in a bush nearby. You feel you are being watched.
7702:Tell him of the skshack you met and the Kurv game that you need to get into.
7703:Kill the cmuch!
7704:You see the cmuch watching you from afar, but still unwilling to come closer. 
7705:[Demon]Say that you know he is good-natured at heart, so he must help his friend, no?
7706:Tell him these demons are hurting you and others for fun. Surely, he'd like to help - if not you, then his own friend?
7707:Just try to catch this demon. Leopold said he will help once you face him.
7708:[Fruit]You heard a rumour that they like fruit. Leave them some and lure and see if they come out.
7709:[Magic user]Use a ritual to track it. It is a demon, after all.
7710:You find several toads, but no cmuch yet. However, you think you've spotted it running from you a few times.
7711:Next time you see that, just run after it.
7712:Spend more time looking for it.
7713:[Fruit]You heard a rumour that they like fruit. Leave them some and see if they come out.
7714:Your ritual worked and a cmuch comes closer, reluctantly.{}{}
7715:Your efforts failed. But you see the little bastard lurking from afar, laughing.
7716:Your lure worked and a cmuch comes closer, reluctantly.
7717:The cmuch comes closer, reluctantly. {}{}{}{}'Fine, they told me I was too slow to play with them, so I will get you in, show them.' 
7718:How can he get you in?
7719:'All you need is a demon really, so for you,  you will only need is this invitation.' {}{}{}{}He hands you a bloody human tooth.{}{}{}{}'It will show you an entrance when the time for another game comes.'
7720:'Well, I suppose I will have to come with you. The tooth will show you the entrance and I will also arrive at that time.'{}{}{}{}He hands you a bloody human tooth. 
7721:You find the cmuch without trouble, and it looks up at you, annoyed.
7722:'Fine, they told me I was too slow to play with them, so I will get you in, show them.' 
7723:You catch the little bugger and it settles down, allowing you to talk to it, reluctantly.{}{}
7724:The cmuch is dead. Not much use for the problem you're having . . .
7725:Even though it beat you, the poor thing must have suffered a heart attack from the stress. The cmuch is dead. Not much use for the problem you're having . . .
7726:The bloody tooth vibrates in your pocket, and you know the invitation to the Kurv game is active. {}{}{}{}Soon you see a portal, and through it a tavern. 
7727:[Demon]Go in.
7728:Wait for the dola to appear and change you into a demon.
7729:Await the cmuch so it can accompany you in.
7730:You enter the back room of an ordinary human tavern. But within, you find an unusual crowd. A hochlick, a pineconette, a skshack, and a tooth fairy all sit around a table, hunched over bowls filled with water. There are dice on the table, and an odd scoreboard behind. {}{}{}{}The tooth fairy beckons to you:{}{}{}{}'Don't know you, but you got the tooth, so in you come. Grab a chair and a bowl and we'll deal you in.'
7731:Sit down.
7732:Attack this bunch and be done with it!
7733:You kill the whole damned party and hope that will stop this ridiculous game. {}{}
7734:Call out to Leopold.
7735:The dola appears:{}{}{}{}'So, ready to face those rascals? Please teach them a lesson. Here, the enchantment will work for some time, but try not to stay too long.'{}{}{}{}You don't feel any different, but she swears they will see you as demons.
7736:Go into the tavern. 
7737:Sit down and say you want to play. No nonsense, just the game -- whatever it is.
7738:The cmuch appears:{}{}{}{}'Well, let's go in. I will be hiding after I make the introductions, so don't expect my help after that.'
7739:You sit down and are encouraged to roll your dice, which are made of bone. As they fall, an image of a human male appears on the surface. The tooth fairy claps his hands:{}{}{}{}'Good, good, a contestant is drawn. Now, when it is your turn, you roll the dice and see what mischief befalls them. All your demon tricks are allowed, of course.'
7740:Nod as if you know exactly what he means.
7741:'The more kurvs and other permitted profanities your man yells, the more points you get. Simple, really. {}{}{}{}Scheming, backstabbing, and trickery are encouraged. Your seat didn't become vacant by chance, ha ha!'{}{}{}{}The others nod, some with enthusiasm, some a bit stressed. The hochlick seems especially worn out. The skshack sitting on your left tilts his bowl to show it to you quietly.
7742:Look in. 
7743:Say that you are ready to begin the game.
7744:[Demon]Everyone is thinking you're just some amateur. But you spot an opportunity to play your first dirty trick, so do it!
7745:The bowl shows one of you! Luckily not sitting in here -- some demon trick, likely from Leopold, shows you camping in a forest and Leopold sneaking up to plant poison ivy in your shoes.
7746:Speak quietly to the skshack. Ask if he knows Leopold.
7747:'Yeah, Leopold had a thing going with the hochlick, but that winged scoundrel cheated, and now Leo is stuck as a pawn in the game. Listen, if you play and win, I will help and we can free Leo.'
7748:Ask what the stakes are.
7749:'Oh, that, well, different things, but mostly the exemption from future games for three years, at least for me. But also, items and such. {}{}{}{}If you fail, you may lose things, or spirit or blood if that stupid fairy wins.'
7750:Ask him if he intends to help in that case.
7751:The tooth fairy speaks:{}{}{}{}'So, as a reminder, the more kurvs and other permitted profanities your man yells, the more points you get. Simple, really. {}{}{}{}Roll your dice, figure out the best ways to annoy your mortal, and have fun!'
7752:Use your people skills here to read the others, bluff, and call their bluff too. 
7753:[Magic user]Use magic to influence your game and make it seem like you are winning.
7754:[Demon]Think of wonderfully mischievous ways to torment your mortal while also cheating your competitors at the table. 
7755:Try to play fair and think of ways to make that mortal swear. 
7756:A skshack is offering his help. Listen. 
7757:You watch and learn and bluff your way to victory. The other demons are miffed, but admit your dominance. The tooth fairy looks angry but asks:{}{}{}{}'So, a newbie wins. Beginner's luck, to be sure. Here, a reward, and you can name a dozen mortals and demons exempt from the games for three years, as per the rules.' 
7758:Exempt? 
7759:Name your people and Leopold. 
7760:Name your people only.
7761:Name your people, but also say you'd like Leopold to remain bound to the game. 
7762:'Ya, that's why goody two-shoes like the skshacks and cmuchs play with us, to protect their charges. Softies. But rules are rules.'
7763:'Alrighty, deal's sealed. Seeya around, preferably not at the table. I ain't playing with you no more.'
7764:Say your goodbyes to the players.
7765:'Interesting indeed. I don't see why not, so deal's sealed. Seeya around, preferably not at the table. I ain't playing with you no more.'{}{}{}{}As the tooth fairy walks off, you see Leopold summoned and put into a cage. He looks your way and smiles as if to say he is happy you won't get hurt anymore. 
7766:'All righty, deal's sealed. Seeya around, preferably not at the table. I ain't playing with you no more.'{}{}{}{}As the tooth fairy walks off, you see Leopold summoned and put into a cage. He looks your way and smiles as if to say he is happy you won't get hurt anymore.
7767:Despite your best efforts, the tooth fairy made his human swear like a sailor, with broken teeth, spoiled food, and the winner - spicy hot paste on his right hand that led to some nasty burns in soft places.{}{}
7768:Wait to see what happens now.
7769:The winner boasts to you:{}{}{}{}'No beginner's luck for you, ha ha. Now, I take one tooth from you, and you are cursed with bad luck. Till next time.'{}{}{}{}As the tooth fairy walks off, you see Leopold summoned, put into a cage, and carried away. You are left standing in an empty, abandoned tavern.
7770:You twist your fate with delicate bursts of magic, and your bowl shows a perfect illusion of 'your human' swearing better than any sailor. The other demons are miffed, but admit your dominance. The tooth fairy looks angry but asks:{}{}{}{}'So, a newbie wins. Beginner's luck, to be sure. Here, a reward, and you can name a dozen mortals and demons exempt from the games for three years, as per the rules.' 
7771:You twist your fate and cheat your way to victory like a pro. The other demons are miffed, but admit your dominance. The tooth fairy looks angry but asks:{}{}{}{}'So, a newbie wins. Beginner's luck, to be sure. Here, a reward, and you can name a dozen mortals and demons exempt from the games for three years, as per the rules.' 
7772:The skshack appears, looks at the carnage, and cries out:{}{}{}{}'Oh dear, oh my dear. I never thought you'd sort it like this . . . evil mortals you are . . . Begone!'{}{}{}{}He disappears in a puff of green smoke.
7773:The creatures beat you and they seem shocked by it, but the tooth fairy regains composure quickly:{}{}{}{}'Why, you fiend. Come into our house with brute force, no cheating, no backstabbing, just brawn. Shame, shame on you! Begone and be cursed by us all!'{}{}{}{}Before you can react, you find yourself in an empty field. No tavern, no demons, no invitation tooth on you.
7774:One of the contestants wasn't looking and you were able to drop blood into their bowl. Blood magic distorts things and should help you win.
7775:Right, look into those bowls, see what they are.
7776:One of the contestants wasn't looking and you were able to drop blood into their bowl. Blood magic distorts things, so it will give you an advantage, but then you realise too late that someone hexed you while you were busy.
7777:'Yes, I will help, but . . . you have to let me win. Let me take some of your spirit, I become stronger, I win. I can free Leo and can name you as exempt from the games too. You just have to trust me.'
7778:Decline, say that you will play the game yourself and win.
7779:The skshack does win and names you among those exempt from the games, but does not free Leopold.{}{}{}{}'Wow, you are gullible. I win, I take it all, and that idiot Leopold will keep being our bitch. Now, off you go before I change my mind and un-name you.'{}{}{}{}As the tooth fairy walks off, you see Leopold summoned and put into a cage. He looks your way and smiles as if to say he is happy you won't get hurt anymore.{}{}
7780:You surprise even yourself as you make the mortal swear like a sailor with your nasty tricks. The other demons are miffed, but admit your dominance. The tooth fairy looks angry but asks:{}{}{}{}'So, a newbie wins. Beginner's luck, to be sure. Here, a reward, and you can name a dozen mortals and demons exempt from the games for three years, as per the rules.' 
7781:Just as you leave, you find a friendly skshack, perhaps some cousin of Leopold has joined you.
7782:Just as you leave, a cmuch who sat quietly in the corner walks over to you, remain silent, but follows you around. Clearly, he was impressed with your skill.
7783:'You - you were sent by Leopold, yeah? Say, maybe I pay you, and you kill that annoying twat. We both happy, eh?'
7784:Kill this hochlick instead.
7785:'Why, why? He a stalker, that why. Wants to get into my pants, for a hundred years now!{}{}{}{}So I finally tricked that tooth fairy fella to help me be rid of the idiot, at least for a time. But then you come along . . .'
7786:So he set up Leopold? 
7787:Say you will consider it, but for a better reward.
7788:'You deaf? Yeah, I did. Now, you kill him? I'll give you my wand, it's good, I swear.'
7789:Killing him seems extreme. Is there another way?
7790:'I suppose if you win the game, you can ask for Leopold to be the pawn for the next three years. Yeah, that will teach him!'
7791:Can he tell you more about the game?
7792:'Nah, that'd be breaking rules, and I am a demon - we ain't too good with law-breaking. You make your way there, and just be sure to win.'
7793:And your reward?
7794:'Oh, that. I'll give it to you if you win, of course. Demon deal is good as gold.'
7795:'Awesome, I'll give you the wand if you win, of course. Demon deal is good as gold.'
7796:'Oh fine, fine, I have this goblin kid stashed away. I'll bring it to you.'
7797:'The wand is cool, I swear. Just get rid of that pest, please!'
7798:The creature is dead. 
7799:'Hey, whoa, fine, fine, I go!'{}{}{}{}The creature flies away.
7800:'Oh c'mon, pretty please? He is such a nuisance.'
7801:You catch Leopold attempting to smear shit on your clothes.
7802:That's it! Kill the little bugger!
7803:Tell him what the hochlick said.
7804:You kill the skshack and the hochlick flies over:{}{}{}{}'Yes!'{}{}{}{}Then he looks at his dead comrade, and you see tears welling up:{}{}{}{}'Damn, now that it is done . . . annoying, yes, but dead, oh dear . . . Anyway, here's your wand.'
7805:What wand? What about the goblin child?
7806:'I said I will bring it to you. There it is, see.' {}{}{}{}He points to a child carried by a swarm of hochlicks.{}{}{}{}'Never said I'd GIVE it to you. Here, have a pet instead. You did me a solid.'
7807:Attack the damned hochlick!
7808:You kill the hochlick and have a chance to rescue the goblin child, if you can get to it before more hohlicks take it away.
7809:Take the child if you can and  leave.
7810:The hochlicks beat you badly and curse you before they fly away.
7811:'Sure, sure, have it, getting way too big for my liking anyway. Off I go, bye.'
7812:'On Lada's good heart, please stop it. Just go play the game. Chill out.'{}{}{}{}He runs off.
7813:'What? Why would she?'
7814:She? 
7815:'Did she say she was a he? She likes playing like that, doesn't matter to me. Why would she say so? We've been best friends for a century. I mean, sure, I think she is a swell hochlick, but I never . . .'
7816:Tell him this is none of your business, but you'd rather not kill anyone, so he'd best sort it out.
7817:Say you are sorry, but a deal's a deal. Attack!
7818:'Just please, go win the game. I swear I will deal with Frix myself.'
7819:'You did it, thanks! That fool will bother me no more, at least not for a few years. I'll think of something after. Here, a reward as promised.'{}{}{}{}Frix hands you the gift and flies away.
7820:'You cruel big folk, preying on us . . . you betrayed poor Leopold so . . . I hate you. I have to give you the stupid wand by law, but I curse you!'{}{}{}{}Frix hands you the gift and flies away.
7821:But he asked you to do this.
7822:'I . . . It's all your fault!'{}{}{}{}The hochlick shouts at you before disappearing. Perhaps it was never Leopold who was having problems . . .
7823:You come across Leopold:{}{}{}{}'I heard what happened. You really attacked them? Brave. Also horribly violent. Still, even though you were beat, they were so shaken that they suspended the game for now. So, I have time to figure my way out. Thank you. Here's a small gift. Bye.'
7824:You find the lake where Bohdan's granddaughters may be hiding. 
7825:Search for them.
7826:You see several women dancing in a circle by the lake. There is a child sitting inside the circle, staring up in awe.{}{}{}{}The sweet melody of their song draws you in . . .
7827:[Destiny or magic user]You will not be swayed by their charms this easily. Keep your head clear and approach.
7828:[Female]The rusalka song is beautiful, but luckily it does not affect females as much. Walk up to them.
7829:Follow the pretty song.
7830:You walk up to the girls and two of them turn to you, startled. The third one continues her song and dance unperturbed. One of the two speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Hey, you are not supposed to disturb us. Do we have to stop now?'{}{}{}{}She asks the other, who shrugs and looks to the third, who is still ignoring the whole thing.
7831:Ask if they are Eva and Anya, Bohdan's granddaughters.
7832:'Oh crap, grandpa sent you? Just tell him to leave us be, we're exploring our roots, finding our true identity. He can't stop us, you know!'
7833:Tell them you were expecting children.
7834:Say it is none of your business, but he seemed old and worried, and it would probably be nice to go tell him they are okay.
7835:'Yeah, well, both mum and him, they treat us like babies, all the time! They're like so old and grumpy, they just don't get us!' Anya's sister nods vigorously. {}{}{}{}The third rusalka frowns and whispers something to the two sisters. Anya turns to you again:{}{}{}{}'Oh, we have to go now. We must finish this dance properly, like. You best go.'
7836:Inquire what exactly this dance is, and whether it has anything to do with the child sitting here.
7837:[Wisdom or water demon]Ask if they are going through an initiation by drowning the child so it may be reborn as one of them.
7838:'We met this nice demon lady here, and she said that because we're half-breeds, we need to prove we can be rusalkas. Otherwise we're no better than a befuddler bastard -- whatever that means. So we have to try to make this child into one of us.'
7839:Ask why their mother hasn't done this herself.
7840:[Wisdom or water demon]So they will drown the child?
7841:How will they make it one of them?
7842:Beat them up and take them back to Bohdan!
7843:'Oh, yes, exactly that.'
7844:'Oh, mum's more of a dwarf wife than a rusalka, ya know. She's like -- the dwarven heritage teaches us to respect life and work with light, create things, and the demon world is dark and dangerous and seductive. She never even took us to the lake, lame.' The sister nods vigorously again, but looks a bit unsure, as if expecting her granddad or mum to pop out at any minute to scold her.
7845:So their mum is a dwarf?
7846:Remind them that their grandfather is old and sick, and he was left to watch them. If they do this now, they will dishonour him.
7847:[Water demon]Tell them they should embrace their demon nature, but beware of falling into dark paths. Tell them of your own journey that led you to serve the cosmic pantheon.
7848:Encourage them to follow their nature, as they rightfully should. Step away and go tell Bohdan of this.
7849:[Perception]You see that Eva, the quiet sister, looks unsure about what is happening. Speak to her directly and ask if this is really what she wants, or whether it would be better to go back to Bohdan and do things the right way.
7850:'Well, yeah, I mean not physically, like, ya know, she is shorter and stockier than us, and our uncles accepted her as one of the family, said she has the stone heart and iron will of a true dwarf wife, or whatever.'
7851:And your father?
7852:'That's rusalka business, ya know.'
7853:'Thanks, so, just tell grandpa we're okay, right? It doesn't mean we don't love him, we're just going this way.'
7854:Say you will do that if you can, then wish them luck and leave.
7855:The girls look sad:{}{}{}{}'He died chasing some cultists decades ago. But he never told us to be dwarves, ya know, he said we should follow our hearts like he and mum did. So we are!'
7856:The melody of the rusalka song rises again and the demons continue their dance, only this time they move closer and closer to the lake. The child follows sheepishly, and soon you hear a loud plunk as they fall into the deep, dark water. {}{}{}{}It all goes quiet after that, and you no longer see anyone.
7857:This time Eva, the quiet sister, speaks up: 'I . . . suppose grandpa would feel really hurt, and his honour is already wounded. We can do this another time. Aye. We thank you for reminding us, we will go back now.' She tugs at her sister.{}{}
7858:Look to the other sister to see if she follows.
7859:Anya nods and follows her sister. The third rusalka looks rather perplexed at all of this, but she shrugs and also starts to leave. The child remains, confused and about to cry.{}{}{}{}The sisters look ashamed of themselves: {}{}{}{}'Come on, kid, we'll take ya back to your mamma before grandpa whoops our arses for this.' 
7860:'We're tired of listenin' to those dwarven tales of honour. We are not dwarves, we're rusalkas. Now go away!'
7861:You beat up the rusalkas but the third one escapes, taking the child with her. {}{}{}{}The two girls are in tears and will follow you back to Bohdan obediently.
7862:The rusalkas beat you badly but let you go. Anya shouts at you:{}{}{}{}'Go tell our grandpa that we are grown rusalkas now, and we ain't comin' back till we know what that means.'
7863:This time Eva, the quiet sister, speaks up: 'I . . . suppose you must be right. So, your gods could show us a way? And we don't have to drown the child? We will go back to grandpa and we will learn of your gods instead.' {}{}
7864:You come to a small lake and see three rusalkas dancing. Their melody is entrancing, of course. {}{}{}{}You know that if you go in any closer, you risk being drawn in by the magic. 
7865:[Water demon]Go in and ask them if they are Eva and Anya.
7866:[Magic user or destiny]You are not easily swayed by such tricks. Go in to ask if they are the girls you are looking for.
7867:[Female]As far as you know, the rusalkas only affect men. Go ask them about Anya and Eva.
7868:You are drawn to the beautiful nymphs, and all you want to do is join their pretty dance. But two of the rusalkas stop their dance and turn to you, startled. The third one continues her song and dance unperturbed. One of the two speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Hey, you are not supposed to be here. Do we have to stop now?'{}{}{}{}She asks the other, who shrugs and looks to the third, who is still ignoring the whole thing.
7869:They turn to you:{}{}{}{}'No, we are not them. You are disturbing us, so join us or leave.'
7870:Join the ritual. 
7871:Leave them be. 
7872:You join their spirit dance and feel the soft touch of air on your feet as you graze the smooth surface of the lake together. {}{}{}{}You feel invigorated and the rusalkas leave you a gift also. 
7873:You try to join in but you are obviously out of sync with the spirits of water. {}{}{}{}The rusalkas disappear into the lake.
7874:They turn to you, changed:{}{}{}{}'You're deaf to our song, but not to our kiss. Come, come play!'
7875:Say that you are happy to play, just not so rough. 
7876:[Magic user]Attack them with your spirit!
7877:The rusalkas lie dead, and judging by the age of these corpses, they were not the young girls you were searching for. 
7878:You do not really remember what happened next. You think you were dancing a lot, then more . . . eventually, the rusalkas leave you be, but you feel used and abused after. {}{}{}{}The apparent age of the water demons suggests that they were not the girls you were looking for.
7879:'Yes, yes, you are fun after all. We are not the girls you seek, though we did see them walk into a cave, if that helps? Now come, dance, we promise to be gentle!'
7880:Dance with the rusalkas.
7881:This is too dangerous, leave.
7882:You find the cave where Anya and Eva may be hiding, according to their grandfather, Bohdan. 
7883:Come back later. 
7884:You walk into a large underground chamber that is dark and eerie. In one corner you spot the two girls, huddling over small rocks and singing in Dwarvish.
7885:[Dwarf]Are they trying to sing the life song to these rocks? Tell them to stop immediately! 
7886:Walk up to them and say that it is time to go back to their grandfather, as he is very worried and sent you here.
7887:'What, who are ya? And why should we stop? We will make a little dwarf and we'll be dwarf wives then!'
7888:Tell them that is not what will happen. These rocks are not dwarven babies. They can't just take any rock, sing to it, and make a dwarf!
7889:Ask if they even know what dwarf wives do, and how you become one. This is some outsider silliness they're playing at here.
7890:'Yer wrong, that's what ya are! We saw these little rocks move. They are so little dwarves.' The other sister nods vigorously. 
7891:They moved? Oh, no. Tell them to step away from those little rockers now! Their troll parents are bound to be close by. 
7892:'Grandpa's always treating us like little babies. Well, we ain't. We wanna be proper dwarves now. But our dwarf family says we can't be dwarf wives because we can't sing the song. Well, we listened and we can! If there is one thing rusalkas can do, it's sing.'
7893:But they are rusalkas. Why do they want to be dwarf wives?
7894:You're not really interested in this. Bohdan said they need to be back home. Now. 
7895:'It is our right to choose. Our heritage. I don't know if we will choose it in the end, but we want to have the choice, right?{}{}{}{}Being a dwarf wife is very important also. We want to prove we can do it.'
7896:And singing to these stones will achieve all this?
7897:'Well, yeah. I mean, we aren't supposed to tell people, but yeah, these stones are babies, and if we sing to them, they'll grow into real live ones, ya know!'
7898:[Perception or wisdom]These rocks do look abnormal, but not really like dwarf children. More like trolls. Little rock trolls. Tell the girls it is time to leave, now!
7899:All right. Allow them to stay. 
7900:'No, we won't go!'{}{}{}{}You are about to argue with them further when you hear a rhythmic thumping moving this way. You look at the little rocks again, and you now see that they are rockers - baby trolls! The girls squeak in fear. 
7901:Grab the rusalkas and run. 
7902:Stand firm and fight the trolls!
7903:You leave the girls be and walk away, but then you hear a terrible roar and a thumping from the chamber. Those little rocks were likely rockers - baby trolls - and the parents will not be nice to those rusalkas.
7904:Turn back and fight the trolls!
7905:Try to grab the girls and run before the trolls get you.
7906:You manage to escape the trolls, and the girls are in floods of tears.{}{}{}{}'We're sorry. Grandpa's gonna be so mad. We'll go back to him now, we swear. Thank ya for saving us.'
7907:Let them go and say you will come to check on them soon, so they'd better not stray!
7908:The trolls hit you with rocks and one of the girls is badly wounded. But you manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for trolls to follow. The girls are in floods of tears.{}{}{}{}'We're sorry. Grandpa's gonna be so mad. We'll go back to him now, we swear. Thank ya for saving us.'
7909:The trolls hit you with rocks and one of the girls is eaten by a troll. You manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for trolls to follow. The remaining sister is hysterical and swears to go back to Bohdan now. {}{}
7910:Take her back to Bohdan.
7911:You kill the trolls and the girls are in floods of tears.{}{}{}{}'We're sorry. Grandpa's gonna be so mad. We'll go back to him now, we swear. Thank ya for saving us.'
7912:'What? Oh, no . . .'{}{}
7913:'It is not! We do know. They are very wise and revered and they not only give life to little dwarves, they also carve their souls and teach them culture and stuff. See, we do know. Our mum and grandpa told us!'
7914:You find that the cave is abandoned - no recent activity. But as luck has it, you discover a hidden chamber and some long-lost loot within it.
7915:Great. Grab it and leave.
7916:'You killed grandpa, you monster!'{}{}{}{}Anya and Eva launch at you, their bodies transformed into demon fiends, and you feel it is your spirit that is being attacked.
7917:You defeat the girls and their bodies oddly turn to stone, as if they were dwarves.
7918:Your spirit drained, the rusalkas take one of you as their prize!
7919:'You killed grandpa, you monster!'{}{}{}{}Anya launches at you, her body transformed into a demon fiend, and you feel it is your spirit that is being attacked.
7920:You defeat Anya and her body oddly turns to stone.
7921:'You killed grandpa! We never wanted him hurt, you monster!'{}{}{}{}Anya and Eva, together with the other rusalka they befriended, launch at you, their bodies transformed into demon fiends, and you feel it is your spirit that is being attacked.
7922:You come across an impressive stone-built smithy standing proudly in the middle of nowhere. You'd swear you passed by here before and did not spot it.{}{}{}{}Outside stands a young shaven dwarf. Inside, you see the outline of an older, bulkier fellow, hammering away at the anvil. You also spot a large pile of rocks by the entrance.
7923:Approach and speak to the dwarf.
7924:Say you do not wish to talk, or help him, leave. 
7925:Accept the job of finding his two granddaughters. [Skip Story]
7926:'Oh, visitors. Splendid. I am Bohdan, a master smith. Say, ya haven't seen a couple of wee girls hiding somewhere, or maybe doing some mischief?'
7927:No, you can't say that you have.
7928:'Ah, well. How would ya feel about getting hired to find them, eh?'
7929:Agree. So he is looking for dwarven girls?
7930:'Well, ya see, my daughter, she asked me to babysit, and, well, I am not as young as I look. I had me a wee nap. I wake up and puff, the little rascals are gone. And Chale here was no help either.' He gives a dirty look towards the pile of rocks.
7931:Chale?
7932:So you're looking for dwarven girls?
7933:'Not strictly, no. They are more rusalkas. Although I always say Anya has my chin, she does, and Eva has that strong arm any smith should have . . . In any case, they be two human-looking lasses, but I bet ya they went to the caves, the misty swamp, or that blighted lake over there.'
7934:Isn't he going to look?
7935:So he had children with a rusalka? 
7936:He shows you his legs and they are partly turned to stone. {}{}{}{}'Like I said, I am not as spritely as I look. Me and my wifey, we met back in the Awakening days, long, long ago. Now I am slowly turning back to the stone I was carved from. Nature. But I really need my grandbabies safe. I will reward you well!'
7937:Agree to look for them.
7938:'Shh, not too loud! She's old and cranky. She's a rock troll, my best friend for a good few centuries now. But useless at babysitting, it seems.'
7939:'It isn't what ya call conventional, sure. But ya know how rare dwarf wives are -well, no ya don't! Not till ya lived as long as me. In any case, yes, I married me Marianna, well, I mean, she was tricked into it and bound by demon law at first, but then we made it work. She's passed now, but our daughter is me greatest treasure, and her wee ones, too!'
7940:'So ya found them rascals. Come in.'
7941:Ask if they have returned yet from the troll cave.
7942:Give your condolences and tell him of the troll.
7943:Tell him the girls wanted to become true rusalkas by drowning a child. You convinced them otherwise.
7944:Tell him the girls wanted to become true rusalkas by drowning a child and you did not interfere with their nature.
7945:Tell him the girls wanted to become true rusalkas by drowning a child. Since they are part rusalka, perhaps that is okay?
7946:'Aye, the dumb rascals got here not long before you. Becoming dwarf wives -- if I ever heard a stupider thing! Them trolls could have had them for lunch. {}{}{}{}In any case, I thank ya, laddies, you saved them and my arse. Here, yer reward.'
7947:Ask if he will teach them how to be dwarves without the danger.
7948:'Aye, thank you. I know ya did all ya could. Silly girls, going into caves, singing to rocks. I did not teach them well enough.'{}{}{}{}Bohdan sobs. And it is Chale, the rock troll friend, that speaks up:{}{}{}{}'You go now. You help, you get shiny gift. But we need to leave, so you go.'
7949:Nod, thank them, and leave.
7950:'Ya dare come here with yer condolences when ya did not save her? I should stick yer head on a pike for my daughter to feast on. Leave us be now.'{}{}{}{}The rock troll, Chale, gets up and slowly moves towards you, their face angry.
7951:'Ya listen to me. I made me choice centuries ago. I am banished, ya see, dishonoured. So I was free to have me a rusalka wife. Now I love me grandchildren, but they ain't no dwarves. They need to be done with this silliness and learn to live like the oddities we all are. That is that. {}{}{}{}Now, excuse me, but I need to knock some sense into some young minds now. You take care of yerselves.'
7952:You kill the dwarf and his rock troll friend, but when you try to loot the smithy, it shakes and crumbles and collapses before you can get any good stuff out.{}{}{}{}You also hear someone cry out from within the ground, probably a hidden tunnel.
7953:[Dwarf] Try searching for the hidden structure.
7954:You find the escape tunnel and a stash of goods. 
7955:Great, take it and leave.
7956:Bohdan and Chale beat you to a pulp, strip you naked, and let you run for your lives. The smithy then disappears from your view and you cannot return there.
7957:The smithy looks locked up, but you see a note:{}{}{}{}'Come back when you've found them. Cheers!'
7958:'Aye, I heard. Drowning little children, just like their grandma . . .{}{}{}{}Well, ya'll be glad to know I aim to knock some sense into those dumb heads of theirs. There'll be no rusalka business under my roof! Oh, and here, your reward as promised.'
7959:Ask if perhaps someone should teach them about their heritage -- just maybe in a safer environment.
7960:'What, like a nice way to be a water demon, eh? There ain't one. Their grandma drowned three of our wee ones before I talked some sense into her. And I swore to my daughter those ones will stay away from that rubbish! They need to be done with this silliness and learn to live like the oddities we all are. That is that. {}{}{}{}Now, excuse me, but I need to knock some sense into some young minds now. You take care of yerselves.'
7961:'Aye, I heard. Drowning little children, just like their grandma . . .{}{}{}{}Well, ya'll be glad to know I aim to knock some sense into those dumb heads of theirs. There'll be no rusalka business under my roof! And ya seem to have got them fired up about that cosmic tree of yours. I will ask a zerca mate to come speak to them. Oh, and here, your reward as promised.'
7962:But if they follow the pantheon, those dark urges can be controlled.
7963:'Can they now? Cause I've lived me a long time, laddies, and I've seen yer godly types do just as bad'a things. {}{}{}{}Still, as I said, a zerca fellow I know well will come speak to them. Who knows. Now, ya best go. I still need to whoop their arses for all this!'
7964:'Aye, I heard. Drowning little children, just like their grandma . . .{}{}{}{}And you, lettin' them do it. Shame on ya! I tried so hard to keep them on the straight and narrow. Ya know their grandma drowned three of our wee ones before I convinced her to try somethin' different . . .{}{}{}{}Just leave me be.'
7965:What, no reward? Attack!
7966:'Aye, I heard. Drowning little children, just like their grandma . . . Ya did the right thing beatin' some sense into their dense heads!{}{}{}{}Well, ya'll be glad to know I aim to knock some sense into those dumb heads of theirs. There'll be no rusalka business under my roof! Oh, and here, your reward as promised.'
7967:A building seems to have appeared close to your location. 
7968:Interesting, perhaps it is worth looking into.
7969:A witch hut walks over to you on its chicken foot, and a voice booms from within:{}{}{}{}'I smell sweet darkness clutching your souls. And where there is demand, I bring supply. {}{}{}{}Pay, my dearies, and your curses shall be cured!'
7970:'Hi there, chosen of the gods! I am your very own divine house demon. Here to aid your home and all that.{}{} {}{}{}{}I shall fight for you in the village, and sometimes I will join you when you are challenged close to the settlement.{}{}{}{}Please do not put me in your party when you leave the village, for I cannot ever leave and with me, neither will you!'{}{}{}{}
7971:A divine house demon - what is that? You look like Theodore.
7972:Can you do anything else?
7973:Welcome him and carry on with your adventuring.
7974:'I am fairly handy around the village. I can craft and gather. And I will become stronger in time. But I cannot leave with you on your travels. I am also cute, right?'
7975:'Well spotted, yes, the gods seem to favour our kind. I'm not sure if we should be flattered or pissed off.{}{}{}{}I am a skshack, but one given the honour to be bound forever to your lovely home, without a choice?{}{}{}{}Anyway, all good.'{}{}{}{}
7976:'Welcome to our food stalls. Now, food isn't easy to get on our lands, so we will only do a food-for-food exchange.'
7977:Trade
7978:Not today, leave.
7979:A witch hut walks over to you on its chicken foot, and a voice booms from within:{}{}{}{}'I smell sweet darkness clutching your souls. And where there is demand, I bring supply. {}{}{}{}Pay, my dearies, and your curses shall be cured! Just remember I like quantity not quality.'
7980:As you stop to refill your water supplies, you find a fish with a golden tail trapped in the shallow waters, thrashing about.
7981:If this is a goldfish, they are known to have magical properties. Speak to it.
7982:Ignore the fish.
7983:Help the fish back into the deeper water.
7984:Eat the fish.
7985:As far as you can tell, the fish is in fact a goldfish. From the waters, another fish pops out, exclaiming:{}{}{}{}'My sister is too weak and she will not last long. Pray help her, quick!'{}{}
7986:Ask for the traditional wish first.
7987:Do as the fish bids you. Free her sister.
7988:Ask if you will get double the wishes since you're helping both fish.
7989:'Fishsticks and draughts! You have not caught me; thus, I am not bound to grant you a wish, and she is too weak for the bargain. Perhaps she will when she is freed.'
7990:Rebuke the fish for trying to lie and bend demon law. 
7991:Free the dying fish.
7992:Refuse to free the fish unless you get a wish. 
7993:'Oh, fine, fine, if you're so wise, why did you ask? {}{}{}{}She is too weak, so when you rescue her, you will do so without the deal.'
7994:Free the dying fish anyway.
7995:The fish regains its strength almost as soon as it is free to swim. It jumps and speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, kind strangers. You released me without the promise of reward, and this is rare. I am bound by laws and cannot grant you a wish, but I can tell you a secret. Do you want to hear it?'{}{}
7996:Yes. Ask for the secret.
7997:No. Decline politely and be on your way.
7998:The trapped fish dies and her sister scorns you:{}{}{}{}'I cannot grant wishes, but I can curse those whom I judge unworthy, and you bastards qualify. Hope your bits fall off!'
7999:'See that lake there? It is called Mokre, which means wet in the old tongue.{}{}{}{}You'd think any lake would be wet, yeah?'
8000:Confirm and wait to hear more of the story.
8001:'Exactly. Now, I am not at liberty to disclose the full implications of the aforementioned name. But if you swim to the middle of the lake, you may or may not find some old castle ruins.{}{}{}{}Beware though, for it is a Wet Lake...'
8002:Convince the fish to be a bit more specific.
8003:Nod and leave to find the ruins it spoke of.
8004:Thank the fish for the useless secret and leave this place. 
8005:'Oh, darn it, I'm gonna be buried in paperwork for this, but fine. {}{}{}{}There's an old castle ruin of blacksword knights, so treasures are likely. But as you swim there, you will hear the weeping of a child.'{}{}
8006:Wait to hear more.
8007:'This spirit child died an awful death, as one might expect, and in its death, it can be very unruly.{}{}{}{}But as you saved me, I will reveal this: sing it a lullaby as you swim past, and you will soothe its weeping and pass into the ruins safely. Beware, though, for there may be more physical adversaries inside!'
8008:Thank the fish for its information and leave.
8009:'Alas, despite your golden hearts, I am bound by countless clauses preventing me from divulging more information on the matter.{}{}{}{}For instance, a clause forbids me to speak of any possible child spirits that may or may not guard fallen castles filled with treasures. Now, fare thee well!'
8010:You refill your water and leave the fish to its fate.{}{}{}{}Later that day, you feel sick. Was it the fish or just bad luck? Who knows?
8011:You help the fish into the water and it swims away, flicking its golden tail at you.{}{}{}{}You turn away to leave and feel a blessing fall upon you.
8012:All right, then, leave.
8013:You help the fish into the water and it swims away, flicking its golden tail at you.{}{}
8014:You eat the fish and feel awfully sick afterwards!
8015:You eat the fish and feel great. It was better than any fish you've ever tasted.
8016:'Rules be damned, my sister's life means more! I will give you my own life force and throw in the location of a treasure I know of. Deal?'
8017:Accept and help the other fish.
8018:Decline and demand a wish!
8019:You come across a small pond, there are signs here that say: 'Drop us a gift of good metal or good  gems and the lady of the lake will bless you.'
8020:Throw in the gift. If you have the right resources.
8021:[Water demon] You've never heard of a lady of the lake, sounds foreign. Dive in to check.
8022:You dive in and search the lake. You spot a female clad in armour, but also wearing a long white dress and carrying a great sword. {}{}{}{}But whenever you get close, she disappears as if behind a veil. You sense she is here, but also elsewhere...{}{}
8023:Throw in the gift.
8024:You see among the low-hanging mist two islands on the lake. {}{}{}{}Most likely, that is where you can access any castle ruins the fish spoke of.{}{}{}{}Strangely, there is a small boat waiting for you at the shore. It is built of fish scales and has a golden tail.
8025:Take the boat to the islands, but be prepared to sing the lullaby to the child spirit, just as the fish warned you.
8026:Take the boat to the centre of the lake and search for the castle ruins the fish mentioned.
8027:As you approach the islands, you hear the faint yet growing sobbing of a young child, intertwined with an unnatural wailing that chills your bones. 
8028:Sing the lullaby to appease the child spirit.
8029:[Magic user] Sing the lullaby and combine it with your own knowledge of the spirits to invoke a binding ritual.
8030:As you approach the islands, you hear the faint yet growing sobbing of a young child, intertwined with an unnatural wailing that chills your bones.{}{}{}{}A thick fog engulfs you, and the cries turn to unbearable shrieks.{}{}{}{}You see ghostly forms in the fog.
8031:Attack the ghosts!
8032:[Magic user] Try to use a binding ritual to cast away these evil spirits.
8033:As you quietly sing the lullaby, the sobbing ceases and the fog in the lake disperses.{}{}{}{}You now see that one of the islands has a stone-built entrance to an ancient ruin.{}{}{}{}The other holds the remains of a small farmer's hut. 
8034:Go to the castle ruins directly.
8035:Check the farmer's hut first.
8036:The entrance looks like old cellar doors or some other utility passage, for it is filled with the remains of caskets, woven baskets, and containers of perishable goods.{}{}{}{}The contents, at first glance preserved in their entirety, fall into dust when touched.
8037:Enter the ruins and go in further.
8038:Within the castle ruins, most corridors and rooms are submerged and buried in mud. But there is a path still intact and miraculously dry. 
8039:Go down the eastern path.
8040:Go down the western path.
8041:Go down the southern path. 
8042:The little house is empty and cold, its floors dusty, and the air heavy. {}{}{}{}Upon scraps of old bedding, you see the ghostly boy rocking and humming the tune you sung him. {}{}{}{}He looks up, and blood spills out of his mouth when he tries to speak.{}{}
8043:Better leave the spirit alone. Go to the castle.
8044:Commune with the spirit, as is your gift. Ask the boy his woes.
8045:'You, you can speak to me? No one ever can. They just run and scream when I try to talk to them.'
8046:Explain to the ghost that his spirit energy is manifesting as an attack because of how much anger or sorrow he has.
8047:'Oh, I see. I didn't know. All I ever wanted is to ask people to find my mommy.'
8048:Ask if you can help find his mother.
8049:'It was so long ago... I was a boy, hungry, afraid. My mommy was dying without food, and the knights, they took everything and sat in their castle.{}{}{}{}I went to ask them for food, went on the bridge, said my mommy was hungry, then my stomach hurt, so cold, so dull...{}{}{}{}Then I was here, alone, and everything was gone.'
8050:The child ghost is clearly bound here because he is looking for his mother. Try to find her remains in the house.
8051:Your ritual bound the child spirit and bent it to your will. Its form flickers from that of a young boy of no more than six, playing happily with a wooden horse alongside a mother, to a starving child clenching its stomach beside a barely living woman, and then you see the face of a knight in armour, laughing. {}{}{}{}The reel of emotions and memories plays over and over.
8052:Continue to explore the castle ruins now.
8053:Talk to the ghost.
8054:The spirits of this place become ever more enraged!{}{}{}{}You are cast away from this place, your own spirit wounded. The islands disappear from your view forever.
8055:Either the fish lied or your singing skills suck, because the spirits of this place become enraged and assault you!{}{}{}{}You are cast away from this place, your own spirit wounded. The islands disappear from your view forever.
8056:You find a chamber that could have been an armoury. As with the foods before, anything you touch turns to dust, except for a single large chest. Its heavy stone design and the runes carved onto the lock tell you that it was made by dwarves.
8057:A piece of parchment smelling of the fields retracts from the lock mechanism with a space at the bottom and a quill for you to write with. Apparently, you are meant to answer the riddle it poses:{}{}{}{}Four dilly-dandies {}{}Four stick standies {}{}Two crookers  {}{}Two lookers {}{}And a wig wag
8058:Use your knowledge to decipher this riddle.
8059:A mamuna -- dilly dandies sound like her hanging teats.
8060:An animal? -- four stick standies sound like four legs, and lookers like two eyes.
8061:A bies? The crookers could be teeth, and a wig wag may be a tail.
8062:You are able to decipher the old tongue further:{}{}{}{}Four dilly-dandies (teats on the udder) {}{}Four stick standies (legs) {}{}Two crookers (horns) {}{}Two lookers (eyes) {}{}And a wig wag (tail)
8063:Cow?
8064:Dog?
8065:A bies bitch? 
8066:I am all on my own, {}{}Wounded by iron weapons and scarred by swords. {}{}I often see battle. {}{}I am tired of fighting. {}{}I do not expect to be allowed to retire from warfare {}{}Before I am completely done for. {}{}At the wall of the city, I am knocked about {}{}And bitten again and again. {}{}Hard-edged things made by the blacksmith's hammer attack me. {}{}Each time I wait for something worse. {}{}I have never been able to find a doctor who could make me better {}{}Or give me medicine made from herbs. {}{}Instead the sword gashes all over me grow bigger day and night.
8067:A dummy.
8068:A shield.
8069:A sword.
8070:A piece of parchment, hot to the touch, retracts from the lock mechanism with a space at the bottom and a quill for you to write with. Apparently, you are meant to answer the riddle it poses.
8071:Read the riddle
8072:A piece of parchment, wet to the touch, retracts from the lock mechanism with a space at the bottom and a quill for you to write with. Apparently, you are meant to answer the riddle it poses.
8073:The letters on the parchment shift:{}{}{}{}'Aye, poor lassies, dumb as oxen you are. Be on your way now!'{}{}{}{}The parchment burns to ash and the chest remains locked.
8074:Bash the chest open!
8075:As soon as you leave this place, the low-hanging fog thickens, and you know you will not find your way here again. 
8076:Continue your journey. 
8077:Either you have dwarven know-how or you're just that strong, but the chest lies wide open for the looting!
8078:Take the treasure and leave.
8079:The runes on the chest glow angrily, but your wit and strength prove superior. The chest lies wide open for the looting!
8080:The runes on the chest glow angrily, and with every hit you feel the room grow hotter!{}{}{}{}You realise just in time that you are about to be devoured by flames, and you run for your life. {}{}
8081:The letters on the parchment shift:{}{}{}{}'Ya almost had it, laddies, almost. Have yourself a pressie from us.' {}{}{}{}The parchment burns to ash and a small compartment with a pouch of coins opens.
8082:Take the coins and leave.
8083:The letters on the parchment shift:{}{}{}{}'Well done, laddies! Here be your treasures, iron and stone to ya!'{}{}{}{}The chest opens.
8084:You do not find any human remains in the house, but you discover a perfectly preserved wooden horse, and you realise the spirit child holds one just like it.{}{}{}{}The boy's eyes light up and he speaks:{}{}'My horsie, you found it. Let's go and tell mommy!'{}{}{}{}The spirit disappears but leaves a trail you can follow. 
8085:Leave this place to follow the trail.
8086:Explore the castle ruins first. 
8087:My home is not quiet but I am not loud. {}{}The lord has meant us to journey together. {}{}I am faster than he and sometimes stronger, {}{}But he keeps on going for longer. {}{}Sometimes I rest but he runs on. {}{}For as long as I am alive, I live in him. {}{}If we part from one another {}{}It is I who will die.
8088:A demon of the winds, like the vily -- without its lord, the wind, it cannot thrive.
8089:A fish in the river - its lord gives it life and flows continuously.
8090:A chosen of the gods, like yourself, surely!
8091:You try to swim to the other island, but just as the spirit child disappeared, so did the island...
8092:The spirits are defeated and retreat. You are free to explore this place. 
8093:Not far from the cursed lake, you discover the remains of what could have been a small village. {}{}{}{}Only moss-covered rubble remains, except for a single slab of stone, surrounded by a circle made of dark granite pebbles. {}{}{}{}The child spirit sits by the stone, weeping. 
8094:Collect the granite. It's a good resource.
8095:As you approach, the spirit looks up and you see through its eyes: {}{}{}{}Upon the stone slab there is a woman chained, naked, with burn marks and open whipping wounds. She is the boy's mother you saw before.{}{}{}{}Knights in black armour with white crosses embroidered on their chest stand in a circle, chanting.{}{}{}{}The woman screams her last in agony. The vision breaks. You still feel the presence of those black knights around you. 
8096:This is clearly a place of power, where remnants of old magic linger. Use your knowledge of magic to try to determine more.
8097:Whatever this place was, it reeks of evil. Destroy the circle and burn the ground.
8098:The vision reminds you of old witch-burning rites used especially by western folk. {}{}{}{}As you recall, they were often used against any who defied the laws of the knight orders. Still, witchcraft is a true threat in the wrong hands.{}{}{}{}Spirits of the supposed witch and her jailers are clearly still bound here. 
8099:Consider your options.
8100:The two spirit groups are in opposition to each another. Freeing one group will be much easier. {}{}
8101:Free the witch and thus hopefully also her poor son. 
8102:Free the knights. After all, they usually served a higher cause.
8103:Try to free both anyway. Whatever they all did in life, surely it is time for them to rest.
8104:You destroy the granite circle and burn the ground around the stone slab to cleanse it. {}{}{}{}There is a massive release of energy that knocks you out for a few minutes. 
8105:Gather yourself up and see what has happened.
8106:The place of power is destroyed, but the spirits are no less active, only freed from their confines!{}{}{}{}You hear the screams of the burning woman, the wailing of the child, and the laughter of the knights until your ears bleed in pain.
8107:Leave this place, quickly.
8108:The place of power is destroyed. You hear the wails of the knights as they fade away and the joyous cries of the woman reunited with her child at last. {}{}{}{}There is an unnerving air of dark magic about her, but she is clearly grateful to you and leaves a reward before she disappears with her boy.
8109:Take the reward and leave. 
8110:You take the stones and feel a cold rush upon you. {}{}{}{}Spirits waken and circle you in anger. They are clad in black armour and chant something in a tongue you do not know.
8111:The place of power is destroyed. You hear the wails of the knights as they fade away and the joyous cries of a woman who appears beside the child spirit who led you here.{}{}{}{}There is an unnerving air of dark magic about her, but she is clearly grateful to you and leaves a reward before she disappears with her boy.
8112:The place of power is destroyed, but the spirits who were bound here are no less active, only freed from their confines!{}{}{}{}You hear the screams of a woman, the wailing of the child, and the laughter of the knights until your ears bleed in pain.
8113:As you cleanse the site and banish the spirits of the knights into the eternal abyss, you stand before the witch-burning once more. This time, your vision seems clearer, untainted by the boy's whims.
8114:Watch the scene.
8115:Whatever the past held, it is of no value now. Simply collect your reward from the spirits you helped and leave.
8116:You see the woman chained to the stone. Even worse, you see the whole village burnt and filled with bodies.{}{}{}{}But you also see many of the knights wounded, torn by some clawed monsters. {}{}{}{}You also sense the presence of great evil within the woman's heart.{}{}
8117:Continue watching.
8118:You see one of the knights plunge a clawed glove into her chest and take out her blackened heart as it still beats:{}{}{}{}'Begone, witch! You and your evil spawn will tarnish this land no longer.'{}{}
8119:The woman screams:{}{}{}{}'I curse you and your sadistic order. For the death of my beloved son, for the suffering upon my kin, I curse you to hear the cries of my child and drown in his tears forever!'
8120:You see the village fall into ruin and the castle sink into the Wet Lake. You hear the weeping of the spirit boy tear the knights' ears until they all die.{}{}{}{}The scene fades. You hear the righteous cries of the fallen knights and the thankful laughter of the witch and her son.{}{}{}{}The spirits you released leave a boon for you before they disappear. 
8121:Take the reward and leave.
8122:You see the woman chained to the stone. Even worse, you see the whole village burnt and filled with bodies. You see children struck through with swords, men decapitated, and women piled up, naked, defiled.{}{}{}{}Although you sense the presence of evil from the boy's mother, you do not sense the same from all who lie dead before you.{}{}
8123:You see one of the knights plunge a clawed glove into her chest with a wicked smile and take out her blackened heart as it still beats:{}{}{}{}'Begone, witch! You and your evil spawn will tarnish this land no longer.'{}{}
8124:You see the woman chained to the stone. Even worse, you see the whole village burnt and filled with bodies.{}{}{}{}You see children struck through with swords, men decapitated, and women piled up, naked, defiled.{}{}{}{}But you also sense the unmistakable, palpable presence of evil emanating from the boy's mother. You see that many of the knights bear scars of combat with clawed creatures, and none of them bear a smile -- just a heavy burden of duty.{}{}
8125:You see the village fall into ruin and the castle sink into the Wet Lake. You hear the weeping of the spirit boy tear the knights' ears until they all die.{}{}{}{}The scene fades. And you now sense the peaceful passing of both sides, no longer locked in their cycle of hatred.{}{}{}{}The spirits you released leave a boon for you before they disappear. 
8126:You see the village fall into ruin and the castle sink into the Wet Lake. You hear the weeping of the spirit boy tear the knights' ears until they all die.{}{}{}{}The scene fades. You hear the solemn vows of fealty and loyalty from the knight order and the desperate cries of the witch and her spawn. The spirits you released leave a boon for you before they disappear. 
8127:The vision, sent by those who you banished to the eternal abyss, shatters and you see only its final result in the real world.
8128:Your efforts fail, and whatever dark force resides here throws you to the side and cloaks the place from mortal eyes once more.{}{}
8129:As you travel through a woodland, you hear the cries of a man:{}{}{}{}'Help, please, someone, help me!'{}{}{}{}They are faint but come from somewhere close.
8130:Ask him where he is and look for the man.
8131:Ignore the cries and leave.
8132:'I fell down into a cave, please, kind folks, help! I come from a wealthy clan. I will give you many goods in reward...'{}{}{}{}The man's voice is fading. {}{}{}{}You find the hole where the man must have fallen and you hear him from below, but it is too dark and deep to see anything, and even throwing a torch down does not help.
8133:Get some ropes out and throw them to the man.
8134:Ask why he is here alone if he comes from a rich clan.
8135:'I'm a scout, a hunter. I was to search this area for resources... my fellow died in the fall... I can still hear his cries... oh, please get me out...'{}{}{}{}The last words are barely audible.
8136:You throw the line down and feel the weight of a man. {}{}
8137:Pull him out.
8138:You pull and pull and out comes a huge snake wrapped around the rope!{}{}{}{}It hisses and whirls but slides away into the wilderness.
8139:Call out to the man.
8140:Damn this man and leave this place.
8141:You pull and pull and out comes a huge snake wrapped around the rope!{}{}{}{}It hisses and whirls and bites you before slithering away!
8142:The man's voice is strained:{}{}{}{}'I... I didn't see a rope, please... please save me... '
8143:You pull at the rope, and this time it is heavy. You think you see the man's furry coat as you drag him out, but it is a bear and it attacks!
8144:You pull at the rope and it seems rather light. A black cat scrabbles up the line and jumps away from you, hissing!
8145:Call out to the man angrily!
8146:The bear is dead, but the man is still trapped in the hole. You hear him whimpering. 
8147:The bear mauls you, then scampers off.{}{}{}{}But the man is still trapped in the hole. You hear him whimpering. 
8148:'I never reached your rope... I don't know what these animals were... help me, I will give you rewards beyond measure, I swear...'
8149:Try pulling him out one last time, carefully!
8150:This time, it is indeed an older man, bearded, exhausted, and ragged. Yet his clothes are of superior quality and his hand ordained with jewelled rings. {}{}{}{}He turns one of the rings and reaches out towards the moon, then disappears without even saying thank you!
8151:Swear at the ungrateful sod and leave.
8152:You come across a caravan of wealthy traders. They approach and ask to talk, but you recognise one of them as the man you saved from the hole, who never even said thanks!
8153:Talk to the traders anyway. See what the man has to say for himself. 
8154:Talk to the traders and demand your rewards!
8155:Attack the caravan!
8156:The man you saved does not speak to you. He hides in the back, avoiding your gaze. Their leader approaches:{}{}{}{}'Ah, travellers, well met! I am afraid we are on the way to resupply, but we still have a few trinkets if you wish to trade with us.'
8157:Tell them the story of the hole, but do it in a diplomatic way.
8158:Tell the story and demand retribution and explanation!
8159:Say nothing of the adventure with the hole and the animals. Ask what they have to offer, and trade with them.
8160:You see the man protest. 'Liars and braggarts! How dare they shame me!'{}{}{}{}But the leader looks unimpressed:{}{}{}{}'It sounds like truth. You were gone for days, you returned dishevelled and weathered, and your story was full of shit. I will pay for my son's life. He will pay for his dishonesty later.'{}{}
8161:The son is taken away by guards, his shoulders slumped in shame.{}{}{}{}The father calls for a chest of goods to be handed to you:{}{}{}{}'I thank you for your deed. My son is troublesome, and he has a tendency towards ill fortune. This is why I bought the moon ring for him, thinking he can escape all trouble. Alas, even with that, he can fail.'
8162:Thank him for the reward.
8163:Ask if you can still trade.
8164:You see the man protest. 'Liars and braggarts! How dare they shame me!'{}{}{}{}The leader turns to you, angry:{}{}'We come to you in goodwill, and you dare to offend my son! Begone, before we whip your arses!'
8165:Leave this ungrateful bunch.
8166:You see the man protest. 'Liars and braggarts! How dare they shame me!'{}{}{}{}The leader stops him with a raised hand, then speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'You are clearly angered by my son's cowardice, and from the sounds of it, rightfully so. I want no enemies, so take this chest of goods and have my wayward son's sword as recompense!'
8167:You kill the guards, but the main body of the caravan gets away, along with the cowardly bastard you once helped. Still, they abandoned  some goods as they fled.
8168:Good, take the loot and go.
8169:You are beaten and robbed, but at least they leave you alive.
8170:Leave quick before they change their minds.
8171:'Good trading with you. May the road keep you safe and the path remain clear.'
8172:A caravan approaches. They call wearily to you:{}{}{}{}'Good road to you, stranger. May we impose on your time?'
8173:Nod and listen to what they want to say.
8174:'We were searching for our chieftain's son. He got lost a ways back. We found him dead in a hole.{}{}{}{}Tales are important to us. A spirit cannot truly rest if their death tale is not told. I do not suppose you know anything of a man in a hole?'
8175:Tell them you did encounter such a man, and he was a trickster so you left him to rot.
8176:Say that you came across a man trapped in a hole, and you witnessed his death heroically fighting a bear.
8177:Deny ever seeing such a man. 
8178:'You just left? How cruel indeed. It is with great sadness that we must now take revenge, for honour and for his spirit to know peace.'{}{}{}{}They draw weapons.
8179:'Your words ring true, and we thank you, for now the story can be completed. Here, have this token of our thanks. We can also offer good trade to you.'
8180:Agree and trade with them.
8181:'I see. Sadness ensues. We will try to find peace for his spirit through another journey.{}{}{}{}Would you like to trade?'
8182:'That does not sound like the man I knew. He was the chieftain's son, but he was a scoundrel and a coward. He'd sooner try to bed a bear than fight with it. This means you had a hand in his death, and we must now defend his honour!'{}{}{}{}They draw weapons.
8183:You slay the nomads and their caravan is yours. You discover they were here on a rescue mission, not trade, but you still find some good produce.
8184:Gather the goods and leave.
8185:They beat you badly and force you to abandon some of your goods to get away.
8186:A terrible storm with violent flashes of bright light catches you on the open road. {}{}{}{}Luckily, you see the ruins of an old manor house, perhaps even a small castle back in the day. Its walls are sturdy enough to give good shelter. 
8187:Take cover!
8188:Stay your path and try to brave the storm. 
8189:You withstand the physical assault without much trouble, but the bright light seeks to cleanse your spirit of all turmoil. You must resist it!
8190:Stay focused and fight it.
8191:The physical assault weakens your resolve, and the bright light seeks to cleanse your spirit of all turmoil. You must resist it!
8192:You persevere and feel strengthened.
8193:Your spirit is assaulted and weakened, but the storm passes.
8194:Damn. Leave.
8195:You hide in the old ruins and the storm rages outside, yet does not enter this place. {}{}{}{}However, you hear a forceful, bellowing voice:{}{}{}{}'This is MY home! How dare you intrude!'{}{}
8196:Ask who is speaking. Insist that you are no threat -- you only wish shelter.
8197:Ignore the voice and try to wait out the storm.
8198:'I am a chort! I am the master here. Go now before you bear my anger!'
8199:Ask what a chort is.
8200:Insist that you must stay here and hide.
8201:Offer your companionship, a good song, a tall tale, and laughter!
8202:Attack this chort.
8203:'Well, a chort, czart, czort, hmm -- devils some call us, or will call us, I never know. {}{}{}{}I am me.'
8204:Insist that you must stay here and hide!
8205:'Bah, what in the underworlds   do I care. Stay.{}{}{}{}But since you're here, will you play a game of cards with me?'
8206:Since he is a demon, you know he is up to some tricks, so you use your own to win. He laughs and rubs his red belly:{}{}{}{}'Ha! Well done. A deal is a deal is a deal.'{}{}{}{}The chort disappears, the castle stands empty, and the storm is gone. But you get a reward for your game.
8207:You play cards and despite being good at it, you lose every hand.{}{}{}{}It seems like the game takes hours, days... you feel weakened, your spirit diminished, as if drained. {}{}{}{}The chort disappears, the castle stands empty, and the storm is gone. 
8208:You play cards and despite feeling that the chort isn't playing by the rules, you manage to win. He laughs and rubs his red belly:{}{}{}{}'Ha! Well done. A deal is a deal is a deal.'{}{}{}{}The chort disappears, the castle stands empty, and the storm is gone. But you get a reward for your game.
8209:The chort agrees to let you stay but makes you play a card game. {}{}{}{}It seems like the game takes hours, days... you feel weakened, your spirit diminished, as if drained. {}{}{}{}The chort disappears, the castle stands empty, and the storm is gone. 
8210:The chort is bewitched by your song and music:{}{}{}{}'Wonderful, wonderful! Will you not teach me how to play?'
8211:You teach the chort to play music and he is enthralled with it. He disappears but leaves you with parting gifts. {}{}{}{}The storm outside settles and you are free to go. 
8212:You sit and wait for the storm to pass, and all seems fine at first. Then you notice strange goings-on. Things in your pack move around, the walls of the old manor house seemingly switch places, and you hear the sounds of people talking behind a corner only to find emptiness.{}{}{}{}You try to leave, but hours have passed in this limbo, and your spirit is diminished...
8213:Damn. leave.
8214:You teach the chort to play music and he is enthralled with it. But being a fickle demon, he tricks you into playing his games.{}{}{}{}You feel that long hours if not days have passed in this place, and your spirit feels tattered. But at least the chort rewards you for your tutelage!{}{}{}{}The storm outside settles, and you are free to go. 
8215:'How dare you! I am a chort and I demand to know the magic of your tune!'
8216:Insist that you carried out your part of the deal and that you will leave now.
8217:The chort frowns and disappears in a puff of stinking green smoke. {}{}{}{}You feel sickened by the fumes, but the storm has passed, and you are free to leave.
8218:The creature lies slain at your feet, and you see the storm has passed as well. {}{}{}{}You are free to continue your travels.
8219:The chort relishes its victory and bellows in a heavy, inhuman voice:{}{}{}{}'Now you know my power, and you will know my displeasure.'{}{}{}{}The creature disappears in a cloud of red-hot smoke that burns your lungs!
8220:You sit down to rest by a tall tree and notice that a stork stands proudly on its top. {}{}{}{}The bird's beak is lowered, and you see that its feathers are ruffled.
8221:Take a closer look. Perhaps it is in trouble. Storks are known to bring good fortune.
8222:Take a closer look at the bird. Perhaps it needs help.
8223:Just ignore the bird and move to another tree before it shits on you.
8224:You climb up the tree carefully so as not to spook the stork and investigate.{}{}{}{}The bird's foot is caught in a metal trap, and this trap is now tangled in the branches of this tree. 
8225:You know how to handle animals. Approach the stork carefully, speak to it, and try to remove the trap.
8226:Try to free the bird despite the fact that it is likely to panic and hurt you while you try.
8227:[Nature or Intellect] Call upon your domain to help calm the bird, then try to help.
8228:You climb up the tree carefully so as not to spook the stork and investigate.{}{}{}{}The bird's foot is caught in a metal trap, and this trap is not tangled in the branches of this tree. 
8229:Put it out of its misery.
8230:You free the stork, and although its foot is still hurt, at least it is free of the trap.{}{}{}{}The majestic bird circles over you three times, changes direction, and makes another three turns.{}{}{}{}You feel a stork blessing is bestowed upon your kin!
8231:You fail to free the bird. It panics so badly that it leaves scratches and bruises on your body as it tears itself away from the tree, leaving its foot behind!{}{}{}{}You hear it screeching in pain as it flies off, likely to its doom.
8232:You kill the bird swiftly, ending its struggle. But you feel an air of dread as you do so. Perhaps storks are not just any birds.{}{}
8233:As you travel across the plains, you hear a screeching sound from a nearby patch of shrubbery.
8234:You come closer and see a small, furry creature with yellow eyes and sharp teeth, its body torn up and trapped in some orc-made snares.
8235:Identify this creature first.
8236:Help the little fella out. 
8237:Leave it be. If orcs left the snares, they may get angry at your meddling.
8238:Put it out of its misery. It looks wounded anyway.
8239:This is most likely a skshack, a house demon and sometimes a messenger for the divine. {}{}{}{}Leaving it to its fate may be a dangerous move, considering their good nature can be fickle if they are mistreated.
8240:You get it free of the snares, but its wounds are clearly infected with some nasty poison. {}{}{}{}The toxic green stuff is spreading fast, and the creature doesn't even cry out anymore. {}{}{}{}This could be contagious.
8241:You have skilled medics and wise men. Try to heal this creature.
8242:Do your best to help this creature.
8243:You cannot risk this poison. Put the creature out of its misery.
8244:Just leave the thing here. It's none of your business and you helped enough already.
8245:You leave the creature to its fate. The screeching cries die down until only a quiet whimpering remains.{}{}{}{}Even days later, you can hear it in your sleep as it tugs at your soul, leaving a lasting mark that you hope will result in nothing more than some sleep deprivation.
8246:As it dies, the creature's body puffs up and bursts into a cloud of green smoke that engulfs you!{}{}{}{}It disappears just as quickly, but leaves you gagging and coughing. 
8247:You manage to cure the poison and patch up the wounds, and the creature perks up within minutes:{}{}{}{}'Gosh, that was a close one! I thank you, me dears, I thank you  profoundly! Now, it would be tradition to offer up my services as a house demon, for I am a skshack -- but alas, I am otherwise engaged. {}{}{}{}Still, debts owed are a bruise on one's ego, so here -- directions to a lair where valuable gifts await your rescue. Now, so long, friends!'{}{}{}{}And with that, the skshack disappears. 
8248:You stumble across a creature lying atop a slab of stone. {}{}{}{}At first he seems to be resting, but as you close in, you see he is breathing heavily and his skin is smouldering under the sun's rays.{}{}{}{}You recognise this to be Smetek, a czort you once helped.{}{}
8249:Try to help the creature.
8250:You try to move the czort from the stone, but he is stuck there by an invisible force.{}{}{}{}He moans in pain.{}{}{}{}A skshack appears and speaks to you:{}{}'Leave it be. The mongrel bies broke rules. It's demon lore. Please leave.'
8251:This can only mean the demon broke a deal. Ask if that is the case.
8252:Ask the skshack what is happening here.
8253:'This czort made a pact to save his own skin. The other side paid its dues, yet this fiend sought to make trouble. Wounded pride, you see.'
8254:Ask more of the pact and how the czart meant to break it.
8255:The skshack clearly speaks of your deal. Just leave this creature to the fate it deserves.
8256:The deal you made? In that case, kill the fiend!
8257:'He hired the services of a kolbuk demon to steal from those who, in his eyes, disrespected him.{}{}{}{}But the kolbuk was a loyal subject, so we were able to put a stop to this infringement!'
8258:Good, demon laws are sacred. Bid the skshack farewell and leave the czort to his well-deserved fate.
8259:Invoke the right of the owed party and save the demon's life by vouching for him.
8260:No harm came to you and this seems cruel. Demand that the demon be released!
8261:'Hmm, you have the right as the other party, I suppose. {}{}{}{}Be wary, though, for if the czort breaks more oaths, it will be on you.'
8262:Change your mind and leave the czort to his well-deserved fate.
8263:The skshack disappears and the czort sits up, no longer held by the spell. {}{}{}{}He looks at you with remorse and does not say anything, only bows and then also disappears.{}{}
8264:In the days to come, you receive reports carried by birds or other critters. You read of many broken oaths, of much trickery and mischief spread.{}{}{}{}The last report ends with a final note that says 'problem solved.'{}{}{}{}But the crimes your good deed made possible weigh upon your morale.
8265:In the days to come, you hear whispers of a reformed czort working hard to help folk in need. {}{}{}{}You feel your morale lifted to hear of such fruits of your good deed.
8266:The skshack shrugs at you and simply vanishes. You still cannot move the czort. {}{}{}{}The only way to free him now would be to break whatever spell holds him.
8267:Attempt to break the magic.
8268:You do not have enough expertise with spiritual matters. Cover the creature from the sun, leave him some water, and depart.
8269:Offer the czort a final mercy and kill him.
8270:The skshack appears again and frowns at your victory:{}{}{}{}'Be wary, for if the czort breaks more oaths, it will be on you.'
8271:You could not break the spell, and by the time you finished trying, the czort had expired, smouldering in pain as the sun burned his insides out.
8272:You execute the czort and see a glimmer of gratitude as he dies from your blade and not the slow, smouldering death the demons had intended. The skshack shrugs at you:{}{}{}{}'I guess that settles it.' Then the skshack vanishes.{}{}{}{}Despite your murderous intent, the czort's final act of gratitude lifted your spirits.
8273:You go about your business setting up a camp when you realise that some of your food is missing. {}{}{}{}Over the next few days, you notice missing bits of equipment -- a spoon here, a sock there.{}{}
8274:Set up bait and observe. 
8275:You have keen senses of perception, and you spot a lizard-like little man-thing come from under the earth and drag its treasures back down in the blink of an eye!
8276:Attack the creature!
8277:Reason with the fiend. Perhaps it can be intimidated into returning your stuff.
8278:It took you many tries to catch the culprit in the act, during which time it took yet more stuff!{}{}{}{}But finally, you spot a lizard-like little man-thing come from under the earth and drag its treasures back down in the blink of an eye!
8279:When attacked, the creature seems to multiply. But it does not help the little fiend, as you killed it. {}{}
8280:The creature is unable or unwilling to speak to you, yet your words clearly left a mark. {}{}{}{}It twists its head and regards you for a time, then hops back into its hole and reemerges with a small bundle. {}{}{}{}It does not give back your food, but it seems satisfied with the trade.
8281:Take the bundle and leave the creature be.
8282:Attack the fiend!
8283:Whatever the creature is, it is not happy with the attention and not willing to interact in any way. It digs into the ground and does not return.
8284:The day is clear, yet suddenly before you hangs a singular dark patch of thundering clouds.{}{}{}{}It's moving fast, but it will not cross your path.
8285:Seems interesting. Investigate from a safe distance.
8286:Leave it be. 
8287:You find a spot to observe the clouds and soon see a hairy, two-horned, hoofed creature riding a small yet very sprightly goat and dragging the thundering clouds behind him. {}{}{}{}The creature seems distressed and looking for something.{}{}
8288:This is likely a type of czart, a devious demon. Talk to it, but remain wary.
8289:Speak to the creature. Ask what is wrong. 
8290:The czart turns to you, his bloodshot eyes glaring with malice for a flicker of a second, then turning to pain and pleading.{}{}{}{}'Yoouknawlthewoy tohoaler?'
8291:[Craft]This czart clearly has a swollen tooth. You've seen enough to know that a good blacksmith can do the job just as well as a healer. Offer to help at a demon price so that it is bound and won't trick you.
8292:A what now? Ask it to repeat.
8293:'Hoealer... borber will do, jost hurry!'
8294:A healer. Yes, this creature clearly has a toothache, and you do have healers. Offer to help at a demon price so that it is bound and won't trick you.
8295:A healer. Tell it you do not know of any. 
8296:The creature looks unsure but nods its head in agreement.{}{}{}{}You take out some thongs and make quick work of the swollen tooth. 
8297:Great. Now ask for the demon deal.
8298:'Bah, I wod corse you for your gall, but I am Smetek the czart, and a deal's a deal.'{}{}{}{}The creature grabs a bag from the goat's back and throws it at you, then prepares to ride off, the thundering clouds in tow.
8299:Bid him farewell.
8300:Ask about the clouds.
8301:The demon nods, so you approach him and carefully remove the offending tooth. {}{}
8302:Great. Ask if he is all right now.
8303:The ailing demon turns to you, his bloodshot eyes glaring with malice for a flicker of a second, then turning to pain and pleading.{}{}{}{}'Yoouknawlthewoy tohoaler?'
8304:[Craft]This czart clearly has a swollen tooth. You've seen enough to know that a good blacksmith can do the job just as well as a healer. Offer to help at a demon price.
8305:'Better, yas.'{}{}{}{}His eyes flicker with malice once more as he adds:{}{}{}{}'How wold you poy me fur my mercy, then?'{}{}
8306:His mercy? Remind the creature of your services!
8307:Show the creature the tooth you removed, and wave the thongs at him to emphasise your deed.
8308:'We are mony czorts, we have our tricks. But this Shottering, it creeps me out. So I am moving my lot.'
8309:Ask if he knows more of the Shattering.
8310:'No. Just that it bad far demon-kin and flesh-kin alike. It comes from the ground and borns us, borns bod.'{}{}{}{}The chort shudders, hops on the goat, and waves you away.
8311:Okay. Leave.
8312:The creature huffs and puffs at you in pain woven by anger. {}{}{}{}The storm clouds suddenly grow and threaten to engulf you!
8313:'Humph.' {}{}{}{}The creature does not add anything, only jumps on the goat and rides off without as much as a thank you!
8314:Damned demon. Leave.
8315:The bies called by the czort to fight for him are dead, but the creature himself escaped. 
8316:The bies called by the czort defeats you and forces you to run. The czort laughs and exclaims:{}{}{}{}'Run, run from your folly, and soon I will be jolly!'{}{}{}{}You have a nasty feeling the czort may not be done with you.
8317:You walk through a forest and come across a young boy sitting on a log and sobbing.
8318:Approach the boy and ask what is wrong.
8319:The boy looks up, startled. He grabs hold of a wicker basket he's carrying and stands up defensively:{}{}{}{}'Who are you?'
8320:Tell him you're just passing by and heard his cries.
8321:Tell him you have no patience for talk. Does he want help or not?
8322:'I was not crying! I was just... I hit my ankle, yeah.{}{}{}{}But, but... you look strong, and you didn't beat me yet. You wanna help, for real?'
8323:Perhaps. But ask why he is here on his own. Surely this is not safe?
8324:The boy thinks for a few seconds, then nods to himself,{}{}{}{}'All right, you win. You look strong and brave. I need blueberries from this forest for my ma, she's sick-like, and only them berries will help. {}{}{}{}But nasty things live there, so I am afraid to go in.'
8325:Agree to help out.
8326:Refuse to help and leave.
8327:'I... I run off, okay? There you have it. Happy?{}{}{}{}But the deal is, my ma, she needs blueberries from this forest. She's, ehm... she's ill and only them berries will help.{}{}{}{}But the forest is scary. I am afraid to go in.'
8328:Ask what he is afraid of since he already ran off.
8329:Say you're a medic and offer to help the mother without those supposed magic berries.
8330:'Well, Gran told me there's armies in there!{}{}{}{}Spiders with crosses on their backs, weaving ropes to catch me, ants marching under my feet, and even butterfly soldiers flying over me to sting my eyes!{}{}{}{}And only the blueberry king can take me there safely, but I called and called and he's not here.'
8331:Ah, the blueberry king. A type of pineconette, a forest keeper. Offer to try to summon it for the boy.
8332:Agree to battle these creatures to help the mother.
8333:Refuse to go into a dangerous forest for berries and rebuke the boy for risking his life, even if it is for a sick mother. Chase him back home and leave.
8334:'Really, you'd do that? You can talk to the blueberry king? Wow!'
8335:Attempt a simple summoning ritual to call any forest guardians present.
8336:Your spirit is not that strong. Consider other options.
8337:'Oh, ugh... well, when I said she was ill...{}{}{}{}You got me. She isn't ill, it's just her birthday and I wanted to do something nice, and she loves them blueberries.'
8338:Rebuke the little rascal, but agree to venture into the forest.
8339:Rebuke the little rascal and refuse him. In fact, chase him back to his village before he gets eaten by something!
8340:As you pass through the woodland, you notice the bustling life around you -- ants marching heavily under your feet, bees buzzing in the branches, birds chirping and flapping their wings overhead -- but you sense no danger yet.{}{}{}{}You finally come to a clearing where you see an abundance of blueberries. 
8341:Gather the berries but remain vigilant.
8342:As you gather the berries, you are attacked by spiders!
8343:As you gather the berries, you are attacked by snakes!
8344:You gather the berries, and apart from some bee stings and ant bites, nothing attacks you.{}{}{}{}The boy claps his hands in joy. 'Thank you, kind sirs, thank you!' He grabs the basket and runs home.{}{}
8345:Good deed done. Now leave.
8346:You were chased away by the critters!{}{}{}{}The boy cries and runs off home.
8347:Well, you tried. Now leave.
8348:A small creature no bigger than a mushroom, with a long grey beard, a pointy hat made of leaves, and a mouth blue with berry juice hops out of the forest and sits on the boy's red hat. The boy remains motionless in fear and wonder, while the critter speaks:{}{}{}{}'You called? I came. Let's hope this won't be lame.'
8349:Ask if he is really a blueberry king.
8350:Ask for help collecting blueberries for the boy.
8351:'Blueberry king I am -- a fine title, no? I've run this berry gig for years. You have business so?'
8352:Ask if he will help the boy with berries for his mother.
8353:Ask if the berries are special somehow, and if so, if you can have some.
8354:'To help this boy would be my joy!'
8355:[Demon]Confirm that this will incur no demon price on you or the boy.
8356:Thank him and tell the boy the good news.
8357:The boy claps his hands in thanks, grabs the basket, and runs home.{}{}{}{}'Thank you, kind sirs, thank you!'
8358:'The blueberries I grow health and beauty can bestow. But beware of their blue blood flowing, for it may also bring misdoing.'
8359:Ask to get the berries for the boy and yourself.
8360:Say you only need berries for the boy, then.
8361:Have the berries for yourself only.
8362:'Ah, demon friend, yes, nothing is without price, but I am inclined to help children in need if they be honest in their intent. So it is up to the boy.'{}{}{}{}A pack of red squirrels brings you the berries.
8363:Nod and take the berries to the boy.
8364:Ask the boy if he speaks true. Say the demon will eat him if he lies.
8365:The boy takes the berries and runs off without so much as a thank you. Later you find out the little bugger sold the blueberries to a rich merchant. {}{}{}{}Alas, soon after, the boy's entire family turns into squirrels and runs off into the forest, leaving the child orphaned.
8366:It is never safe to lie to demons. Leave.
8367:The boy takes the berries and runs off without so much as a thank you. Later, you find out his mother is well again, and she brings you a bundle of gifts as thanks. 
8368:Tell her it was no problem. Leave.
8369:The boy bursts out crying again. 'Oh no, no, don't eat me, I was lying! I was gonna sell the berries. Everyone knows the berry king likes kids.'{}{}{}{}The blueberry king snarls and, for a second, turns into a savage giant squirrel. The boy screams and runs off. 
8370:Shake your fist at the child.
8371:The king turns back into his small form and laughs: 'Well done there, my friends. It never gives me joy to be cruel to a child, but when they break the rules, well... Here, have a few of the berries -- they may reward you well or may just be tasty. Bye!'{}{}{}{}He disappears.
8372:Take the berries and leave.
8373:'I am no liar, honest sirs!'
8374:Give him the berries.
8375:Nothing happens and the child runs off, spooked by your odd rituals.
8376:'Ah, try as I may, it will not do, I can only help one of you.'
8377:'Shame on you, shame indeed for such greed. {}{}{}{}My berries you will have still, but we will see how you then feel. Begone.'{}{}{}{}A pack of red squirrels brings you the berries.
8378:Take the berries.
8379:Don't take the berries. Just leave.
8380:Hidden within green shrubbery, concealed by the veil of the night but illuminated by the stars, you witness a gathering of four creatures of the spirit world.
8381:Observe some more.
8382:They are all looking into a puddle of perfectly clear water. Within, there is a reflection of a small human babe.{}{}{}{}The creatures are small and seem to have wings. One seems to have a squirrel tail. Mostly, they are obscured from your view by an ever-present mist.
8383:[Goblin]Ah, goblin lore deals with the spirit realms. Consider what these creatures might be.
8384:Consider whether they are demon kind.
8385:Just stay quiet and keep watching. 
8386:These are vrozka, a type of pixie creature -- fickle and fleeting, but generally of good intent towards those they deem worthwhile.{}{}{}{}Some folk used to call them goblins in the olden days because the vrozka is a creature of both the spirit world and the material world, and as such used to be close with goblin kin. {}{}{}{}You were sure they became extinct during the long night.
8387:They seem akin to some house demons you know like bozeta, kransnoludki -- little folk who cared for humans. But it is odd to find them here, and the wings don't fit. Perhaps hochlicks doing some odd magic? 
8388:Kill the little pests, whatever they are!
8389:The creatures speak into the water:{}{}{}{}'I will bless you with the grace of a young birch tree.' {}{}{}{}'I will grant you the gleaming gold from the earth's core.'{}{}{}{}'I will bestow upon you the boundless beauty of a spring flower.'{}{}{}{}'And I will make your eyes twinkle with the depth and purity of the oceans.'{}{}{}{}After a pause, the last creature speaks again:{}{}{}{}'I shall deem your heart filled with goodness.'{}{}
8390:Stay still.
8391:The forest creatures argue over whose gift was best, but the last one bellows at the others:{}{}{}{}'Quiet! Let the strangers answer your ignorance. What say you?'{}{}{}{}You know she speaks to you now, as you feel her eyes upon you.
8392:Beauty? It will surely help to attract the right mate.
8393:Grace of the young birch. It may prove priceless to be so flexible yet strong.
8394:The eyes - their depth will surely be a sign of wisdom.
8395:Goodness, to honour the lady Lada. All other gifts will then follow anyway!
8396:Goodness, so it may brighten the dark days.
8397:They are all worthless. The world is cruel, and neither beauty nor goodness will help.
8398:Gold, of course! We can trade, craft. It will set the child up.
8399:'Perhaps there is some truth to your words, yet goodness of the heart is the truest gift.{}{}{}{}Beauty of man or flower alike wilts away, birches are nimble but break, bright eyes go blind, and gold can lead to greed and despair.' {}{} 
8400:Ask how goodness is any better in this world.
8401:If the sun did not give us warmth and hope, it would be a mere ball in the sky. Without goodness, nothing is right, beauty becomes like a scentless flower, love becomes a fire that only burns, and riches only the way to selfishness and greed. {}{}{}{}Goodness will outlast it all and can light the way.{}{}
8402:This creature is clearly deluded. Smile, nod, and move away.
8403:Kill them all to show them how little their goodness means!
8404:'Ah, yes, you do understand!{}{}{}{}Your lady is the embodiment of what I speak and the mother to my kin, for when darkness came, it broke us but for the one sparkle that was Lada's birth and thus our rebirth. Goodness will outlast it all and can light the way. This child will grow and follow your lady, and we will make sure that more will. For now, we leave you.'
8405:Bid them farewell and good luck.
8406:'Yes, goodness of the heart is the truest gift. Beauty of man or flower alike wilts away, birches are nimble but break, bright eyes go blind, and gold can lead to greed and despair.'{}{}{}{}The creature presents you with a gift for your right answer.{}{} 
8407:Thank her. Bid them farewell and good luck.
8408:You walk away, and the creatures ignore you.{}{}{}{}Despite your hasty retreat, the whole encounter leaves you with unnaturally good humour.
8409:Just keep going.
8410:You agree wholeheartedly, so you stay, sing songs, and dance. You learn that the babe is a little princess, and you feel like you should also give her gifts.{}{}{}{}You generously donate some of your things for the precious little girl, then leave.
8411:Well, goodness of the heart is the thing! Rejoice and leave.
8412:You agree wholeheartedly, so you stay, sing songs, and dance. You learn that the babe is a little princess, and you feel like you should also give her gifts.{}{}{}{}So you write her some songs and poetry. You never even knew you had it in you! The whole thing leaves you feeling great.
8413:You try to kill the creatures, but they disappear in a puff of mist, leaving you feeling bad about yourself and your wicked heart.
8414:'Oh, an audience, splendid. My younglings need lessons learned. Will you take part in our birth blessing for this little one?'{}{}
8415:A birth blessing? Ask her whether they are vrozka.
8416:Ask them first to tell you who they are and what exactly a birth blessing is.
8417:'We are, yes. And you are the spirit folk! How splendid. {}{}{}{}You wonder how we still live?'
8418:Yes. Ask for an explanation, as you assumed the vrozka died off during the darkest night.
8419:'We were doomed in darkness when it came, but we held on to a sparkle of light that was born -- the lady Lada. {}{}{}{}She is our new mother, for she gave us life anew. {}{}{}{}Now, for the birth blessing of the child, my younglings will each grant a gift, and so will I. We shall see if they know the value of gifts, yes?'
8420:You know vrozka to be honest folk. Agree.
8421:[Lada] Say that you too are a child of Lada.
8422:'We are vrozka, pixies, sylvas, many names in many places. We are what you call demons. Or spirits, more like.{}{}{}{}The birth blessing is a ceremony of gift giving. This child's parents believe in us, so we will bestow the blessing.{}{}{}{}Will you observe?'
8423:'How wonderful! Yes, I should have known, marked by the lady you are, indeed. Say, in that case, may I ask a boon of you?'
8424:No. Say you are too busy. But tell her you'd like to watch her ritual now.
8425:'A small matter, yet it grieves my heart. An old friend has fallen ill, and I cannot help. Here, this will lead you to them. Even if you can only give them company in their last hour, I would be very grateful.'
8426:Nod and promise to go when you can. But stay and watch their birth blessing ritual first.
8427:You come across an old, dying oak tree. This must be the friend the vrozka spoke of.
8428:[Forest folk] You are kin to the forest. Try to sense what ails this ancient tree.
8429:[Nature] Your deity is of nature, so use your nature domain to sense the tree's peril.
8430:It looks like a dying tree. See if you can still use it for firewood.
8431:There isn't much you can do but keep the tree company until it passes away, as you promised.
8432:You examine the tree. It feels as if some corruption twisted it from within and caused a slow, inevitable death.{}{}{}{}But you are able to release the last of its forest spirit, and for that, you feel a blessing upon you.{}{}{}{}You also know some of the remaining wood will be poisoned, but could be useful as such.
8433:Good. Collect the wood.
8434:Leave the oak in peace. It seems wrong to scavenge the corpse of a sacred tree.
8435:Some parts of the tree seem usable, but as you try to collect the wood, you feel a sting of poison.{}{}{}{}It is, however, easy to handle now that you know of it.
8436:Collect the wood so that you may get some use out of it.
8437:You collect the poisoned wood and leave the old oak to its final days in peace.
8438:You leave, and although there is no tangible boon, you feel the gratitude of the old spirit.
8439:Use divine intervention to try to heal this oak.
8440:You did it! The oak is cleansed, and although it will take years to heal, now it can live again.{}{}{}{}You feel your god's pleasure upon you.
8441:The intervention could not heal the ancient oak, but for your attempt, you feel your god's pleasure upon you.{}{}{}{}At least the tree did not die alone, and it is now within your right to claim the wood.
8442:You sit by the dying ancient tree and feel its life force dwindle until it is but a husk. {}{}{}{}You feel the grace of your lady upon you for your good deed, and now you can also take the wood without disrespecting woodland rules.
8443:You come across the remains of what once must have been a prosperous village. {}{}{}{}It stands near a vibrant stream. Many of the homes were made of stone and even the path through the centre is paved.
8444:Walk towards the centre, carefully. 
8445:As you approach the central square, you see a stone-built well, a bell house, and what looks like a perfectly preserved  weaving loom, complete with strands of half-finished spider silk linen, simply standing there on its own.
8446:Search some of the houses, but stay wary.
8447:You see a vision of the village of Babiniec, vibrant and bustling, its weaves being sold to traders from all over the island.{}{}{}{}Sitting at the loom is a tall, slender woman with a stern, disturbing face, unnaturally shaped long arms, and beady black eyes.
8448:Allow this vision to flow. 
8449:Focus on what Nyia wishes you to know. You have no time for visions.
8450:You see the folk grow fat in prosperity. You also see them destroy their chrams and abandon prayers. Worse yet, you see them conduct a burial with no respect paid to Nyia.{}{}{}{}Instead you notice idols of foreign deities! Coins being placed onto the eyes of the dead, entrails removed and embalmed...{}{}
8451:Blasphemy!
8452:Finally, you see the strange woman still sitting at the loom. On her neck hangs the symbol of Nyia.{}{}{}{}As she weaves with ferocity over seven nights, the town is tangled in a silver web of death that holds them captive as a procession of mares brings plague to this rotten land.{}{}{}{}The vision fades.
8453:Such a strong curse from Lady Death herself is bound to linger. Make your way out of this village.
8454:This village disrespected the goddess and worshipped foreign deities on her land. For this they suffered death at the hands of the mares -- plague bearers. {}{}{}{}You sense that you could release the souls now, although you would have to risk your own spirit and perhaps the wrath of your goddess too.{}{}
8455:Release the poor souls, despite it being contrary to your lady's will.
8456:As you leave, you see the figure of an old woman still weaving at the loom, and you find a parting gift in your pack. 
8457:Your spirit was too weak to see the truth of this place, but you feel that Lady Death scorned this land with her curse. {}{}{}{}Your spirit is weakened by this scourge.
8458:You perform the burial rites and feel a heavy burst of energy shake the ground. {}{}{}{}The bodies burnt, you feel that their souls remain ailing, but in time some of them will now pass through to the underworlds.{}{}{}{}The souls that will be free whisper to you. 
8459:As Nyia's chosen, open your soul to this place and learn what befell it.
8460:Within the houses you find bodies of the villagers dried up and frozen in a grimace of terror. Their arms and legs are bound by weaves of spider webbing.
8461:[Zerca] Burn the bodies and perform the proper burial rites. 
8462:Burn the bodies out of respect for proper burial rites.
8463:Search the bodies for loot.
8464:The bodies burnt, you feel that their souls remain ailing and bound to this cursed place. Some great force is clearly bent on tormenting them.{}{}{}{}You could try offering up a prayer to ease their passing.
8465:Try it.
8466:No, better just leave.
8467:You pray and feel a heavy burst of energy shake the ground. {}{}{}{}The bodies burnt, you feel that their souls remain ailing, but in time they will now pass through to the underworlds. {}{}{}{}As the souls are released, you hear them whisper.
8468:Listen to the whispers.
8469:They speak of a doom of their own making, of angering Lady Death by worshipping foreign gods. They speak of a lone woman surviving at her loom, weaving their death in honour of Nyia.{}{}{}{}Before you depart, you see a woman working at the loom, her eyes and mouth sewn shut, yet staring at you!
8470:Time to leave this place! Go.
8471:Your prayers stirred an ancient curse and your spirit is weakened. Before you depart, you see a woman working at the loom, her eyes and mouth sewn shut, yet staring at you!{}{}{}{}You feel a sickness in your stomach and know it is time to run.
8472:You find a lot of good spider silk and some trinkets.{}{}{}{}But, busy in your search, you do not notice as the village becomes engulfed in mist and figures of night mares -- harbingers of plague and death ride through!
8473:Try to outrun them!
8474:Attempt to stand and fight.
8475:You run away but feel sickness strike some of you. Still, it could have been much worse, as you now sense the clear touch of Lady Death herself upon this place. {}{}
8476:You barely get away and feel sickness strike you hard. {}{}{}{}Still, it could have been much worse as you now sense the clear touch of Lady Death herself upon this place. {}{}
8477:You defeat the night mares, yet feel a dread in your bones as you sense the presence of Lady Death herself here!{}{}{}{}Some of you may grow stronger from this, but for others, a sickness lingers even as you leave triumphant.
8478:The souls are released, and you feel that even Nyia agrees with your mercy.
8479:Move on from this place.
8480:You release the souls, but you feel the anger of Nyia upon you. {}{}{}{}As you leave, you see the figure of an old woman still weaving at the loom, her face sewn shut, her eyes black beads of emptiness. She points at you, and you feel the sting of a needle upon your bodies.{}{}{}{}Then she disappears.{}{}
8481:You come across a small settlement, mostly human. There are several huts huddled together and, surprisingly, also a small sawmill.{}{}{}{}The place is quiet and sombre. Wreaths of herbs hang on the doors, likely to keep some sickness at bay.
8482:[Healer]You know how to cure illness. Go into the village and try to help these folks.
8483:Stay vigilant and careful, but go in to see what has happened here. 
8484:You could catch this illness. Better just leave.
8485:You enter the settlement and find the people huddled in the largest hut, while the few still well enough to walk tend to them.{}{}{}{}A girl looks up at you and quietly nods in thanks as you try to help.
8486:Try to figure out a cure and tend to the people. 
8487:An old woman, hunched over, hobbles towards you and looks up, her eyes full of wisdom.{}{}'Thank you, strangers, but you best be off. A czort holds us here and you only delayed his trickery.'
8488:[Wisdom]Ask why she thinks it is a czort. You know demon lore, and a czort is not known to bring illness. 
8489:Ask what type of czort did this and how it could be stopped.
8490:Agree with the woman. Say your goodbyes and leave.
8491:An old woman, hunched over, hobbles towards you and looks up, her eyes full of wisdom.{}{}'Thank you for trying, strangers, but you best be off. A czort did this and no mere medicine will fix it.'{}{}{}{}You do feel a chill run through you, and you'd not expect it this fast from a natural illness.
8492:The woman spits, 'The czort's ways are devious. I know it is his doing! You see that weeping willow yonder, by the sawmill?{}{}{}{}It was not there when the moon last rose. It is known that czorts love willows, I tell you!'
8493:Ask if anything can be done.
8494:Ask more about this czort business.
8495:'No one goes to the willow since Janko went and never came back. Then the blight deepened, and now we can barely move.{}{}{}{}Maybe you can go. You look sturdy.'
8496:Sturdy or stupid? Still, agree to go and check this weeping willow for czorts.
8497:Refuse - you've done enough.
8498:'When I was still a lass, my grandpa told me of Gnievko, the brave woodcutter who tricked a czort and got himself this sawmill. {}{}{}{}But czorts dislike being bested. This is their revenge, I tell you.'
8499:How did he best the czort?
8500:Say that you've heard enough. Can anything be done about the creature?
8501:'Gnievko was out cutting logs for the village and there sat a red stinking czort on a tree, crying and swearing.{}{}{}{}He said 'I curse you human, curse your butt to have warts for eternity, if you do not take me down!'
8502:But Gnievko was wise, and he asked the czort why it couldn't come down.{}{}{}{}The czort wailed and swore, but seeing the man would not budge, he snorted:{}{}'It is a linden tree I sit on, and if I come out of this bag, this tree will burn me!'
8503:A linden tree is bad for czorts?
8504:'Aye, so Gnievko found out. The czort was thrown on the tree by a rival. So Gnievko said to the czort, I know your demon kind, your tricks and deals. If I take you down, you will grant me a wish, and I best never see your kind again, hear me?'
8505:'The czort agreed and the wish worked, but Gnievko was no fool. Knowing what he knew, the last part of his wish was that only linden trees would surround his village and give him the prosperity he wished for.' {}{}
8506:So why was the czort angry?
8507:'Czorts, you see, are dastardly folk. They'll do your deals and honour the codes, but then they come back to toy with you. Not always, but often enough.{}{}{}{}But with the lindens here, the bugger could not stay, so he moved on. Till now.'
8508:Why now? How did the willow get here?
8509:'That part I do not know. It was just there one day, and that's when our woes began.'
8510:All right. Agree to help them.
8511:Refuse -- you've done enough.
8512:'The only thing I can think of to help is to take some linden wood with you. Here, have some wicker. You can tie the bastard up with it and throw him away.{}{}{}{}Good luck, friends. May the gods bless you for helping us common folk.'
8513:Take the wicker and go see the willow tree.
8514:You approach the weeping willow and at first glance it looks like an ordinary tree. {}{}{}{}Perhaps the only oddity is that all the linden trees that once grew around here are now dried-up stumps.
8515:[Mysticism]Circle the tree three times, throwing bits of the linden wood you brought, to create a protective barrier.
8516:[Nature]Open yourself up for divine inspiration.
8517:[Demon]If one of your demon kin lives here, you should know. Address it.
8518:Take the linden wood and approach the tree, weapons at the ready.
8519:You circle the weeping willow and with each pass you hear a hissing sound.{}{}{}{}On the third turn, a voice shouts,{}{}{}{}'Oi! Off with you and your tricks! It stings, but I am not budging!'
8520:The creature showed its weakness. Now that you are sure the linden works, strengthen the ritual and perform a banishing spell.
8521:Nature speaks back to you and you feel that the weeping willow is twisted and dark inside. It was brought here by magic but another, previous spell is hurting it very badly.{}{}{}{}The other trees around are also suffering, dead or dying.
8522:Focus on the weeping willow itself. Call upon nature to banish the demon's magic. 
8523:The willow tree stirs, and a hairy face appears from within.{}{}{}{}'What do you want, eh? This spot is taken!'
8524:Remind the demon that he broke the laws by moving in here despite the deal with Gnievko.
8525:Ask the demon to do you a favour and move along. He is hurting those people really badly.
8526:Offer him a deal: you won't burn down the tree with him inside if he buggers off now.
8527:'Bah! I did no such thing, ha ha! I made a deal with this weeping willow and it came to live here. Now my original deal, you see, stated that no other trees can grow in the village, especially not willows.{}{}{}{}But this one didn't grow here. Ha!'
8528:Remark that it is indeed a clever workaround.
8529:Scorn him for nitpicking. Say that the laws of a deal must be honoured. He had his fun -- time to move on.
8530:Say that whatever the case may be, he is bending rules and you were asked to get rid of him, so he'd better move along. Shake the linden wood at him.
8531:You build a bonfire and burn the linden wood, allowing the smoke to engulf the weeping willow. {}{}{}{}The czort -- a short, stubby, red-haired, goat-like creature -- hops out and tries to flee, but he is bound to the willow and cannot.{}{}{}{}Believing he will burn, he finally relents and gives up his hold on this place. If you wish, you can continue the spell to kill him.
8532:Continue the spell and see the czort destroyed for good.
8533:With his hold broken, the czort will now leave. Let him.
8534:'Oh, the caring sort, are you? Got yourself some fleshy friends, following their gods, even, eh?{}{}{}{}What's in it for me?'
8535:Offer a gem as payment. 
8536:'Oh, you! How did you know I can't leave this tree? Damned demon traitor, you are. {}{}{}{}You wouldn't do it, would you?'{}{}
8537:Do not admit it was a lucky guess. Just stare at him threateningly.
8538:Shrug and say you were just guessing, but now you know his weakness so he'd better go!
8539:'Hmm, why not, I was getting bored. See ya!'{}{}{}{}Upon his departure, you discover a stash of some good quality wood.
8540:Great, tell the villagers the good news and be on your way.
8541:'Oh, all right, all right! I am leaving. I was getting bored anyway!'{}{}{}{}The demon leaves and the curse will now slowly lift in time. Upon his departure, you discover a stash of some good quality wood.
8542:The willow tree stirs, and a hairy face appears from within.{}{}{}{}'Get out of here, scum!'
8543:Try to reason with the creature. Say that it has done enough and had its fun, so it's time to move on to new deals and new tricks.
8544:Tell the creature it is hurting the trees! It will pay now -- attack!
8545:It seems too much trouble. Just leave.
8546:'I know! Say, since you're being all nice, here -- I got some spare wood from when the other trees died. Can't touch the stuff myself, so you may as well have it.'
8547:Thank him, take the loot, and leave.
8548:Remark that you were asked to do a job and those folks are dying. Can he not leave now that he's had his fun?
8549:He shrugs. 'Well, why not. I am bored. Have the wood anyway, then. See ya!'{}{}{}{}The demon leaves and the curse will now slowly lift in time. 
8550:Tell the villagers the good news and leave.
8551:'I am not done! You bore me now. Leave or suffer my wrath!'
8552:Just leave. Not worth your trouble.
8553:You kill the demon, and with his dying shrieks, you feel the willow tree regain its natural strength.{}{}{}{}It will likely take a long time for the czort's curse to fully heal, but it will happen eventually. As the wind blows, you hear a faint 'Thank you.'{}{}{}{}You also find a stash of good wood left behind by the demon.
8554:You fail and the czort is not happy. As you run away, you feel the sickness that befell the villagers fall upon you!
8555:Damn the czort. Keep running.
8556:The czort shrieks in pain and eventually shrivels away like dried-up fruit. The remains turn into a decent ruby.{}{}{}{}The curse is lifted immediately, and now the people will regain their health quickly.{}{}{}{}You also find a stash of good wood left behind by the demon.
8557:The czort shrieks in pain and disappears in a puff of green smoke that gets into your lungs. What effect this may have, you know not.{}{}{}{}The curse is lifted immediately, and now the people will regain their health quickly.{}{}{}{}You also find a stash of good wood left behind by the demon.
8558:Tell the villagers the good news and be on your way.
8559:The weeping willow begins to gently rock, its green hair dancing to the unheard tune of your prayer. {}{}{}{}The tree trunk twists and shrinks in the dance, and from within a hollow, you hear the screams of a dying creature. Blood flows down the tree's bark, but it remains unflinching.{}{}{}{}It then spits out the remains of a czort.
8560:Good. Gather whatever items it had and move on.
8561:Your prayers are not strong enough, or perhaps nature is not willing to interfere. {}{}{}{}Your spirit is weakened, and dark magic repels you from returning here.
8562:As you wander through the woods, you hear something rummaging in the bushes, then a short, stubby, red-furred creature riding a goat rams into you.{}{}{}{}'Shit, watch where you go!'
8563:Point out that you are the ones being assaulted here.
8564:Take out your weapons and growl at the creature. How dare it cross your path like this!
8565:Shrug and walk away.
8566:'Well, I say, the cheek of it! You were clearly in MY way.{}{}{}{}Bah, who cares. Here, I got you a gift, your ilk once saved my hide, and I repay my debts.'
8567:Do not accept the gift, remembering that this demon assaulted a village because it did not like being bested in a deal. 
8568:You aren't making any deals with it, so take the gift.
8569:'Oh, fiddlesticks! Fine, be like that.'{}{}{}{}He strides off in a huff. 
8570:You take the bundle and find some goods within, but you also feel a curse befall you.{}{}{}{}The czort strides off, laughing.
8571:Damn the czort! Leave.
8572:Perhaps the czort did appreciate your kindness. You take the gift and nothing else happens.{}{}{}{}The czort disappears, smiling.
8573:Great, leave.
8574:The seawaters stir and swirl before you in irregular circles and sudden bursts.{}{}
8575:As nature's domain is your guide, seek answers from your deity.
8576:[Wisdom]Your knowledge of the mystical is sound. Try to figure out what this could be.
8577:Ignore it, doesn't seem dangerous. 
8578:Get in closer to investigate.
8579:Leave this area.
8580:These waters are surely disturbed, but you sense that this is not unnatural. {}{}{}{}Creatures of the sea swarm this spot -- hailki-gailki demons they are sometimes called, and a promise of new life lingers here. {}{}{}{}But in these troubled times, you sense these creatures' cycle is being stifled by a strong presence of light energy.
8581:[Elf]As elven kin, you are a child of light. Try to use your spirit to help these creatures. 
8582:[Orc]You feel the pressure of this place strongly; the light burns at the tip of your soul. Use your opposing domain to try to break its hold, even if it is more dangerous for you.
8583:This concentration of light is unnatural indeed. Try to perform a ritual to cleanse this place.
8584:Do not interfere with this. Best leave them be and continue onwards at a distance.
8585:[Wisdom]What else could you do here?
8586:Stay and observe.
8587:Hunt the fish-demons down.
8588:These are likely hailki demons, a rare breed of water creatures that are generally harmless on their own but are heralds of a coming hurricane.{}{}{}{}Due to their mating rituals, they come up to the surface only once a decade. But it is said that their eggs are actually gemstones, so some folk try to hunt them for it. 
8589:In that case, hunt them down. 
8590:Leave them be. In fact, wait a bit to make sure others don't come to destroy these rare creatures.
8591:You stay and observe as the water continues to swirl and burst. In time you notice small, serpent-like creatures with multicoloured scales and tiny demon horns. {}{}{}{}You realise before long that a hurricane is forming, but the creatures are shielding you from it in thanks for your kindness.{}{}{}{}Your spirits are greatly lifted. 
8592:You stay and observe as the water continues to swirl and burst. In time you notice small, serpent-like creatures with multicoloured scales and tiny demon horns.{}{}{}{}You notice a group of fishermen sneaking up to the creatures. They have not seen you yet.
8593:Attack the fishermen!
8594:Convince the fishermen not to kill the hailki. 
8595:Just leave it. This is too much risk for fish. 
8596:The swirls and sinkholes increase in intensity, and you notice now there may be some sort of serpent-like creatures swarming there. {}{}{}{}You also realise the sea and skies are getting very restless. A storm is coming this way fast!
8597:Best leave here fast, then.
8598:Stay and try to hunt for those snakes, even if it means taking some bruises from the wind.
8599:The swirls and sinkholes increase in intensity, and you notice now there may be some sort of serpent-like creatures swarming there. {}{}{}{}Before you can see more, a hurricane engulfs you, thrashing you around like puppets before you land on the ground again.
8600:Keep moving to safety.
8601:The swirls and sinkholes increase in intensity, and you notice now there may be some sort of serpent-like creatures swarming there. {}{}{}{}The creatures emit a faint light and soon it looks like they're swimming in a rainbow. You continue walking, and your spirits are uplifted.
8602:You capture several of the serpent-demons. Their light extinguishes when they're out of the water, and the entire pack turns grey and slithers away in silence. {}{}{}{}The light from the serpents lingers on your skin and stings. You have a feeling that you interrupted something important. 
8603:You open yourself to the unnatural concentration of light here and the force moves towards you, leaving the serpent-demons free. {}{}{}{}You see the creatures bustling with life and energy, and the water turns into rainbow from the display of light reflected off their scales.
8604:You stay and observe as the water continues to swirl and burst. In time you notice small, serpent-like creatures with multicoloured scales and tiny demon horns.{}{}
8605:You soon realise this is a mating ritual, but you also know that something has gone wrong. A bright, stifling light engulfs the serpents and their bustling dance slows, clearly stopping whatever was supposed to happen. {}{}{}{}The serpents swim away, and your spirit is hurt from the light still lingering.
8606:With the fishermen gone, the serpent-demons continue their odd water dance in peace. {}{}{}{}You do not have time to observe them, but you feel their blessing upon you.
8607:The fishermen beat you badly and force you to flee.
8608:While you talked, the fishermen captured the serpents and left you standing there looking silly. 
8609:You fail to catch the serpents and you feel their demonic power lashing out at you, forcing you to flee.
8610:The hailki-gailki continue their mating ritual, and a hurricane forms above your heads, yet you remain protected.{}{}{}{}The light you called your way, however, now engulfs you and threatens to burn your soul. You may siphon some energy from it, but it may also wound you.
8611:Leave before the light does you harm.
8612:Stay and try to siphon some energy.
8613:You open yourself to the unnatural concentration of light here and the force moves towards you with immense power. {}{}The serpent-demons boil alive as the water bubbles with heat, and you feel your spirit assaulted.
8614:A black cat crosses your path.
8615:Spit over your left shoulder seven times before walking onwards. This should stop any bad luck. 
8616:Stand still until another living being crosses the path. It's the only sure way to avoid the bad luck.
8617:Just keep on walking. It's only a cat.
8618:[Magic user] Black cats are often witches' familiars. Follow the cat to see where it lives.
8619:This could be a demon in cat form. Place a small offering of food on the road. If the cat comes to you, it will be good luck. If it walks on, it will bring misfortune.
8620:The cat ignores you and continues onwards. {}{}{}{}As far as you know, you should be safe now or maybe even lucky.
8621:The cat skulks around and runs towards a small nondescript house. Hard to say if a witch lives there.
8622:Go in, weapons drawn.
8623:You stand there on the empty road for a while until an unsuspecting squirrel passes by. {}{}{}{}As far as you know, you should be safe now or maybe even lucky.
8624:You find the house abandoned, covered in cobwebs and dust though some resources remain salvageable.{}{}{}{}The cat sits by the bones of a dead human. It looks at you, pleading.
8625:Burn the bones in accordance with witch customs.
8626:The cat watches you perform the ritual, and you feel strange energy fill the air. {}{}{}{}Your souls seem nourished by this deed. 
8627:You find the house infested with rats!
8628:With the rats defeated, you see a very happy cat running off with the meat. {}{}{}{}The house is decrepit and old, with not much to pilfer.
8629:The cat walked towards you, so you expect luck to come your way soon!
8630:The cat walked away, so bad luck may follow!
8631:Your home is visited by a black cat at night and somehow you know you met this one before.{}{}{}{}It purrs and lingers in your household, avoiding direct contact yet observing you constantly.
8632:The cat seems to favour the nursery. Better go check on the children.
8633:Observe the cat to make sure it doesn't do anything bad.
8634:The cat clings to one of your children and you realise it was never a cat, but a dola demon seeking to find a new charge to take care of. {}{}{}{}The child will surely grow to be lucky, and the whole household feels the positive effects.
8635:Give the cat some food in thanks.
8636:The cat shows you a spot where you dig up a hidden cache of goods. It then goes away.
8637:The cat sits by a person who was unwell, and, in the morning, they feel much better.
8638:The cat runs off when followed, but you realise the fleabag brought all sorts of nasty disease into your home!
8639:Damn the cat.
8640:You realise too late that the cat was a witch's familiar and the old hag used it to siphon some of your spirit for her dark arts!{}{}
8641:A full moon hangs heavy atop the calm waters. You set up camp to rest, doing everything the same as always -- check the area, set watch, stay alert.{}{}{}{}Alas, one your children wanders off to throw stones in the water, and with a sudden splash, they disappear beneath the surface of the crystal-clear lake!
8642:Run in and try to get them out!
8643:Sitting on a beautifully crafted raft made of seashells and pearls, an amphibian-looking man cries out to the moon:{}{}{}{}'So much you have given, so good my fortune, oh why, oh why won't you grant me this one more boon, lord?'
8644:Disturb him politely to ask if he has seen your child or anything else suspicious in the last few minutes.
8645:Shout at the creature and ask where your child is.
8646:Attack it. The child is gone and this fiend may know what happened, so a good beating will speed things up!
8647:'I beg your pardon, traveller, I was merely voicing my woes to the moon, as it once granted me a great boon, but now keeps me cursed.'{}{}
8648:If he speaks of Horz, the night lord, say that you are also one of his.
8649:The child? 
8650:'Horz, Horos of old, yes. The moon master came to me once. I did him a boon and in return he freed me from my vodnik life and made me a potoplenyk, master of the water castle!'
8651:Ask how it is that a god changed his being.
8652:'Oh, angry, are we? I guess I understand. Were I able to have a child of mine, I'd be protective too.{}{}{}{}The child is in my castle, deep within the waters, and you will not get to it if I am dead, just in case you were thinking of a forceful act.'
8653:[Water demon]Tell him to wipe the smug smile off his face and point out that you are no stranger to the waters!
8654:Stay calm. Ask again why he took your child and ask him to give it back.
8655:You jump into the icy cold waters and search for the child but find nothing, only the dark, quiet depths looking back at you.{}{}{}{}And then you hear an odd whimpering sound farther down the shore.
8656:Go see what it is.
8657:'Ah, yes, another effort on your part. Surely it will fail, but what can I do?'
8658:Threaten the creature and tell it you will have your child back, now!
8659:'Ah, my bad... I did not truly see you there, hmm, cousin.{}{}{}{}You all have your magic, your ways to get children. I was only trying to do the same, only mine drown and die and never turn into one of me.'
8660:Say that you are not amused by this and he'd better give back the child right now!
8661:Tell him you do not need help to get the child back from his underwater home, so he will die now. Attack!
8662:'I took your child because I cannot have my own. I thought this time, this time the waters will truly make it mine, but it doesn't look likely.{}{}{}{}And do remember, I am the only one who can bring it back from my underwater lair.'
8663:[Attractive]Putting on your best smile, convince him that if the child dies it can serve no one, but if he releases it, you will do your best to help -- and you have gods on your side.
8664:Ask why he is doing this?
8665:'Like I said, I did Horz a boon and he said I am vodnik no more, that I will have my own castle, my own power and nothing to do with my cousins and their duties and hierarchies and such.'
8666:The child, then?
8667:Say that your child had better be fine, or the lord Horz will have his scales for it!
8668:Attack this fiend now. It will tell you where to find your child with a sword at its throat!
8669:'Well, if you must know, the moon lord changed me, that he did, so I am the only one of my kind! Or at least I know of no others, and the usual water demon reproduction doesn't work right for me!'
8670:So he cannot change children into water kin by ritual drowning, then? Nor can he lure females and have them carry his spawn?
8671:Ask what he means by this.
8672:He frowns:{}{}'Well, no to the first one, they all just become water wrights -- empty, solemn things.{}{}{}{}But to the other... well, look at me! I have no looks to lure a female here, never mind copulate with me.'
8673:Suggest that if he gives the child back safely, you can lure someone here for him.
8674:'Yes, I sense a divine touch upon your heart. Better not meddle there. {}{}{}{}Have the child back if you must.'{}{}{}{}The demon clicks his fingers and a pack of water wrights brings out your child locked in a huge seashell. It is alive and well, asleep and unaware of the ordeal.
8675:'Well, typically, water demons drown the folk, children mostly, and they come out like us -- most of them, anyway. But mine never do.'
8676:'It's a deal, cousin! Have your child back, and any others that still live. {}{}{}{}But lure me a female, please!'{}{}{}{}The demon is so excited that he pays you no heed, instead clapping his hands, brushing his tendril hair, and grinning stupidly into the water.
8677:Do as you promised and use your demon wiles to lure a female here for him.
8678:Kill him -- the disgusting creature will not have his way!
8679:Leave and ignore your deal. This creature does not deserve your help.
8680:Your skill at attracting folk works well, and soon an unknowing female finds her way to the lake where the demon awaits. {}{}{}{}He snatches her and they both disappear underwater. Now you understand why he has trouble reproducing, seeing as his mates likely drown.
8681:'No, no, I don't think you're right. I think this is my castle, my place, my rules. But this has failed me many, many times. {}{}{}{}So let us make a deal. I smelled some orphans not far from here, but too far for a water dweller like me. Bring me those children and I will set yours free -- easy, no?'{}{}
8682:Reluctantly agree. At least it gives you time to come up with a plan.
8683:Agree wholeheartedly.
8684:Attack this creature. Once it is beaten to a pulp, it will talk!
8685:'Here, I marked the spot on this map. See you when you get back. And worry not -- your child is asleep in a shell for now. I never got around to the drowning part. Your presence was distracting.'
8686:Leave to find the children.
8687:The creature, which, despite his protestations, seems like just another vodnik demon, lies beaten at your feet.{}{}{}{}'Stop, stop, please!'
8688:Demand the child, now.
8689:'Okay, okay, I will just swim down to get it.'
8690:Laugh at his words and press your sword to his throat. Demand that he give back the child now or die.
8691:Say that is fine, but you will of course accompany him.
8692:'All right, all right, here...'{}{}{}{}The demon clicks his fingers and a pack of utopiec brings out your child locked in a huge seashell. It is alive and well, asleep and unaware of the ordeal.
8693:Now kill the damned fiend and then search his underwater palace too!
8694:Let the demon go. You will not dirty your hands any more than you need to.
8695:Now kill the damned fiend.
8696:You kill the demon and dive underwater to search the castle. {}{}{}{}You realise the structure is slowly sinking into the sea floor -- likely part of the demon's magic. {}{}{}{}But you manage to scavenge some goods before it goes.
8697:The demon dies and the waters stir for a time, turning murky. {}{}{}{}A strong stench hits your nostrils and makes you ill. But the water also spits out some wreckage. Perhaps you will find something there.
8698:Search the wreckage and leave.
8699:The creature, which, despite his protestations, seems like just another vodnik demon, lies beaten at your feet.{}{}{}{}Alas, you suspect your child is being kept deep underwater, and you have little chance of getting to it in time.
8700:Try to dive for the child.
8701:You dive deep and discover the remains of an underwater castle. Alas, with the demon's death, the abode has begun to sink into the sea floor.{}{}{}{}You spot the child and a huge treasure chest, but you only have time to grab one...
8702:Grab the child.
8703:Grab the treasure. 
8704:You dive deep and discover the remains of an underwater castle. Alas, with the demon's death, the abode has begun to sink into the sea floor.{}{}{}{}You grab some small loot on your way, but the child is nowhere to be seen.
8705:You kill the demon and dive to retrieve your child. Deprived of its master, the creature's underwater abode is sinking fast, but you are faster and manage to get some extra loot as well. 
8706:Good, now leave.
8707:The demon is fierce and defeats you, but he does not kill you. Instead he simply jumps into the water and disappears without a trace.{}{}{}{}Alas, he does not return your child.
8708:You kill the vodnik while he is distracted. As he dies, the waters turn murky and grey, and a horrible stench hits your nostrils and makes you sick.
8709:Just as the water demon said, you come across a ransacked caravan with empty carts and stripped bodies. Among the rubble sits a lone child, and two dead ones lie beside it.{}{}{}{}
8710:Take the child with you, and go back to the vodnik to fight it!
8711:Take the child and give it to the vodnik, as promised.
8712:Take the child and leave, do not give it back to the vodnik who sent you here.  No point risking a confrontation with the vodnik.
8713:The vodnik lies beaten at your feet.{}{}{}{}Alas, you suspect your child is being kept deep underwater, and you have little chance of getting to it in time.
8714:You dive deep and discover the remains of an underwater castle. Alas, with the demon's death, the abode has begun to sink into the sea floor.{}{}{}{}You grab some small loot on your way, but the child is nowhere to be seen.{}{}
8715:The demon is fierce and defeats you. {}{}{}{}But he does not kill you. Instead he simply jumps into the water and disappears without a trace.{}{}{}{}Alas, he does not return your child, and he also kidnaps the one you saved earlier.
8716:'Ah, good, good. Here is your young one, safe and sound and even with a blessing from me. Be well, friends.'{}{}
8717:You come across a small hamlet and see the folk are out in force proceeding with the hanging of a man.{}{}{}{}Cries of 'bandit,' 'scoundrel,' and 'bastard' fly around aplenty.
8718:Go have a closer look and ask someone what is going on.
8719:Leave them be, not your business.
8720:'Ah, this is Rabsik, a known scoundrel. We caught him stealin' our coin. We're not rich folk, and this gold will feed us for months. So now he's gonna hang good!'
8721:Ask if they are sure they got the right man. Was he caught red-handed?
8722:Attack this rabble of farmers. You'll gladly take their gold!
8723:Step back and allow justice to take its course.
8724:[Harmony]Plead for the man's life. Say that there are other ways to punish him, but the goddess Lada teaches us mercy.
8725:'Aye, red-handed in our cookie jar! And this scar he has on his cheek, this is Rabsik, all right. In fact, the orcs have a bounty on his head, so we'll get us some of that too!'{}{}{}{}Another man kicks the speaker in the shins and others shake their heads at him. He goes quiet and the crowd returns to the hanging.
8726:A bounty? In that case, tell them to let you have the man or you will kill them all! [Intimidate]
8727:The farmers mumble in anger but take their leave, hiding in their huts. {}{}{}{}You take your prisoner down from the hangman's noose. {}{}{}{}'So, you thinking of selling me to the orcs now?'
8728:Confirm that that is your intention.
8729:Say that you may rethink the plan if he has something to offer.
8730:Deny it. Tell him you only wanted an excuse to free him. No man should die for gold.
8731:'I can take you to my stash, it's all yours. There's some gold, some gems -- not a fortune, but it's all I have.'
8732:Decline and take him to the orcs for the bounty.
8733:'How odd. Not sure what to do with that. I was gonna offer you my loot, then have my buddy eat you up. Now it feels kind of mean.{}{}{}{}I'll get you my stuff, for real, no tricks.'
8734:He was going to trick you? Just kill the weasel.
8735:Nod with satisfaction that your good deed may yet turn a dark heart... maybe. 
8736:You kill the man, and a dying whisper in the old speech lingers on his lips:{}{}{}{}'Debie, debie, kto cie zrebie,{}{}Ten do smierci panem bedzie.'{}{}{}{}(It refers to some old oak, that whomever cuts it will be rich till death.){}{}{}{}You hear the trees rustle a faint cry as the bandit dies.{}{}{}{}Perhaps you can find this oak tree he spoke of and find his stash.
8737:You meet with the orc band searching for the bandit. They pay you the bounty and take their prisoner.
8738:Good. Time to leave.
8739:You agree to let him lead you, but as soon as he enters the forest, he disappears from your bonds.{}{}{}{}You still hear his voice guiding you, however, so you can still find the loot.
8740:Mark the place of the treasure on your map.
8741:Folk justice takes its course and the bandit is hanged, his body left as a warning to all who pass here. A dying whisper in the old speech lingers on the man's lips:{}{}{}{}'Debie, debie, kto cie zrebie,{}{}Ten do smierci panem bedzie.'{}{}{}{}(It refers to some old oak, that whomever cuts it will be rich till death.){}{}{}{}You hear the trees rustle a faint cry as the bandit dies. Perhaps you can find this oak tree he spoke of and find his stash.
8742:Reluctantly, the mob agrees with your pleas. You hear whispers of 'We'd better not upset the goddess, that lot looks like they may have her ear.'{}{}{}{}Rabsik, the bandit, looks surprised as you take him down.
8743:Check that he is okay and tell him he'd better choose a different path in the future.
8744:The farmers kick your arse and you run for your lives. {}{}{}{}Rotten tomatoes and horse dung fly your way as you do.
8745:Just keep running.
8746:The farmers are dead and their gold yours. You can now also collect the bounty on this bandit.{}{}{}{}You take your prisoner down from the hangman's noose. {}{}{}{}'So, you thinking of selling me to the orcs now?'
8747:'Just mind your own backside! Now leave us be.'
8748:'Hmm, unexpected. Well, if you thought I'd be grateful and give you stuff, sorry, no. But I do thank you, and maybe I've learnt something, eh? Bye.'{}{}{}{}He runs off, but you feel uplifted by the good deed.
8749:You come to an old oak tree. Rabsik points at it.{}{}{}{}'Here it is. My treasure chest is hidden in the roots. Should I take it out, or...?'
8750:You are forest folk, and this is no tree -- it is a leshy clearly watching your every move! Call them out on it.
8751:Say that Rabsik can take the chest out, but warn him against making any sudden moves.
8752:Say that you will take the chest out, but tell him it had better not be a trick.
8753:The leshy smiles, his features now clear,{}{}{}{}'Ahhh, youuu broughttt sooome foorest kinn to mee. Here, thisss isss whaaat you were prooomised, yes?'{}{}{}{}The leshy gives you a small chest of loot. The bandit looks annoyed, but does not say anything.
8754:Take the loot and leave.
8755:Ask why a leshy is working with a common criminal.
8756:He reaches into the roots and the tree swallows him whole. {}{}{}{}Before you have time to react, you realise the roots are shooting up from the ground beneath you, trying to entangle your feet, and you know this tree is a leshy attacking you!
8757:You kill the leshy and the bandit and take the loot. 
8758:You manage to wrangle free and run away, and you hear the bandit's laughter carried in the wind.
8759:The leshy captures you and holds you within his roots for what seems like hours. {}{}{}{}He then spits you out, and you feel your spirit drained.
8760:The leshy does not respond, but Rabsik speaks.{}{}{}{}'Common goals, mutual cooperation -- that sort of thing. My friend here finds himself lacking in, well, lackeys, so I do stuff for him to help the forest, and he helps out with my... trade.'
8761:Tell the leshy it is shameful to aid robbery like this, that nature's domain should remain neutral.
8762:Nod and say you wish them good fortune, but they had better not steal from you.
8763:The leshy's leaves rustle and a gust of wind almost topples you as he sighs.{}{}{}{}'Neutral isss looonely. I caare not foor goold trinketsss. I caare nooot of thoose who loost them. {}{}{}{}Buut you speak with the voice of nature. I will oobey.'{}{}{}{}The leshy falls into slumber and you know he will not wake for many decades now.{}{}The bandit cries out in anger but runs off.
8764:Good. Now time to leave.
8765:He reaches into the roots and the tree swallows him whole. {}{}{}{}But you notice he was not the least bit surprised, and you realise that the tree is a leshy that will likely now attack you!
8766:You reach into the roots to take the chest, but you spot just in time that this is no tree, but a leshy!{}{}{}{}The forest demon grabs you, but you have time to catch the bandit and hold your sword to him. {}{}{}{}The bandit holds out his arms:{}{}'Okay, okay, let's not do anything rash. My friend here is just protection, he wasn't going to hurt you.'
8767:Tell the leshy to let you go and surrender the chest, or you will kill the bandit.
8768:Let the bandit go as a gesture of goodwill, and say that this is not the way to treat each other.
8769:Try to wriggle free from the leshy while still holding his friend hostage.
8770:'Yeees, I agree. Let Rabsik go, and haave the chest heere.'{}{}{}{}The tree produces a wooden chest and places it next to you, then releases its hold over you.
8771:Let Rabsik go, as agreed.
8772:Move away from the leshy, then kill Rabsik and run away.
8773:You reach into the tree's roots to grab the hidden chest, but instead, you feel the tree grab your arms!{}{}{}{}It is a leshy and it attacks!
8774:You wriggle free from the leshy's grip. It looks angry, but luckily for you, it is unable to move your way.{}{}{}{}Rabsik, the bandit, cries out:{}{}{}{}'Come now, you're free, let me go!'
8775:Kill the ungrateful sod.
8776:Demand your treasure, now.
8777:Let him go.
8778:'Fine, fine, take it, the chest for me -- a fair exchange. We'll do it all together like.'
8779:Agree, take the chest and release the bandit.
8780:The bandit looks puzzled as he runs off and climbs his friend. {}{}{}{}'Yeah, you're odd. So, no hard feelings. Bye.'{}{}{}{}He disappears inside the leshy and the demon remains still, watching you.
8781:The leshy tightens his grip and drains your spirit, but luckily for you, he discards you and allows you to flee.
8782:The leshy tightens his grip on you.{}{}{}{}'Nooo! Yoou leet himm free, or yoou die!'
8783:Attack the leshy instead!
8784:Agree to his terms and let the bandit go.
8785:You let Rabsik go and the leshy also releases you. The bandit isn't happy about it, but the demon insists that a deal's a deal.{}{}{}{}Rabsik turns to you:{}{}'So, no hard feelings, let's just part ways.'{}{}
8786:You come to an old oak tree, and you think this is where Rabsik hid his treasure.
8787:You are forest folk, and this is no tree -- it is a leshy watching your every move! Call them out on it.
8788:Investigate the site carefully.
8789:The leshy smiles, his features now clear.{}{}{}{}'Ahhh, youuu broughttt sooome foorest kinn to mee. Here, thisss isss whaaat you were prooomised, yes?'{}{}{}{}The leshy produces a small chest of loot for you.{}{}
8790:As you walk around looking for the hidden loot, you feel the ground move.{}{}{}{}Before you have time to react, you realise that roots are shooting up from the ground beneath you, trying to entangle your feet, and you know this tree is a leshy attacking you!
8791:You kill the leshy and take the loot. 
8792:You manage to wrangle free and run away, and you hear the leshy's laughter in the wind.
8793:The leshy frowns and sighs:{}{}{}{}'I haad need of himm, he haad need of me. It waas good.' {}{}{}{}
8794:Nod and say it is not your business. Take your gold and leave.
8795:The leshy's leaves rustle and a gust of wind almost topples you as he sighs:{}{}{}{}'Neutral isss looonely. I caare not foor goold trinketsss. I caare nooot of thoose who loost them. Buut you speak with the voice of nature. I will oobey.'{}{}{}{}He falls into slumber and you know he will not wake for many decades now.{}{}
8796:As you approach, the tree opens its eyes, looks at you, and asks:{}{}{}{}'Where isss Rabsik?'{}{}
8797:Tell him the bandit is dead, but you followed his instructions to get here.
8798:'Instruuctioons, youu saay... doubtfuul. Laast trick, hee meant. The fool. Shaame. Loonely timees coome again...' {}{}
8799:Ask what trickery he means.
8800:Inquire about the treasure.
8801:'Cuut mee down, they saay, and riches be yours till your dying daay.'
8802:Convince him that no such violence is needed because a leshy has no need for things, surely.
8803:'Agreeed. Haave it, haave it aalll.'{}{}{}{}He spits out a chest for you, then falls silent.
8804:Take the loot and leave him be.
8805:The leshy remains silent, his features becoming more treelike again. 
8806:You come across a small hamlet of humans. As you approach, you see the folk downcast and weary, skulking behind closed doors.{}{}{}{}A couple of armed guards stop you:{}{}'Who goes there?'
8807:Tell them you are travelling and mean no harm. 
8808:Assess their threat level. 
8809:This is none of your business, so leave.
8810:'You'd best move along, then. Our homes are cursed, and we do not want to spread our troubles to others.{}{}{}{}Unless -- are you well versed in such things? Our wise one passed three moons ago, and we have none to guide us.'
8811:Tell them that yes, you are well versed in mystical matters. Ask exactly what befalls them.
8812:Say that you are on the path of the gods, so even though you are not wise ones, you may be able to help. 
8813:Ask if the problem is physical in nature, for you are good with your blades.
8814:Judging from the size of the hamlet and the quality of the guards' weapons, you would face five to eight good men before the rest would give up. {}{}{}{}You wonder how they survived on their own here. 
8815:'Thank the gods!{}{}{}{}Every third night, when the sun sleeps, an unliving corpse comes among us. {}{}{}{}At times it only walks, and wails.{}{}{}{}It destroyed our chram and we think it killed our wise one too.'
8816:Ask if anything odd happened before it appeared.
8817:'It is hard to say. We had a bad year. {}{}{}{}Poludnica burned our farmers, so our crops were few. {}{}{}{}Then the mory came and brought us sickness. Many died last moon, and many were buried. Then the unliving came.'
8818:Tell the man you can see there is more to the story, so he'd better tell the rest.
8819:Say you will stay in the hamlet for three nights and watch for this fiend.
8820:If it is unliving, it can be ended with a good blade. Ask if they have tried.
8821:'Yes, some of us tried. But it was fast and strong, and many of our best died when the mory came.'
8822:Tell them you will stay for three nights and kill this fiend.
8823:The man nods silently and you settle in to stay.{}{}{}{}On the third night, just as he said, you spot an unliving corpse blundering blindly between the houses. {}{}{}{}Its body flickers from physical to spirit form, and you see no head on its shoulders.
8824:You have prepared rituals to call upon the dead. Use them now to try to determine what this apparition wants.
8825:[Magic]It is unclear what this creature is, but your connection to the gods may chase it away. Preform a prayer ritual.
8826:Whatever this creature is, attack it now before it harms more folk.
8827:Actually, this looks too dangerous. Leave these people be.
8828:[Elf]Take a closer look at this spirit, for you feel some affinity to it.
8829:[Spirits]Try speaking to your fellow spirit, as it appears to be in pain.
8830:'Well... {}{}{}{}The mory, the poludnica before. We blamed Agna -- a, well, a girl from the village. {}{}{}{}So, well... we, we didn't give her medicine when the mory came. It was time for her to go. We buried her proper like, head between the legs so she stayed dead.{}{}{}{}Only she didn't...'
8831:Tell him 'head between the legs' works only during a blood moon on strigas who were born with two rows of teeth. It does not work if she was not one. Ask more about the girl.
8832:Tell him that was cruel, and if the girl was not a striga, she may now be a vengeful spirit rather than an unliving. Say you will stay and observe.
8833:Say that you understand why they did it, but obviously it did not work. You will deal with this creature if you can.
8834:'She... I mean, we never knew if she was a he or a she, one of those. But she was ours, old Yanna birthed her, although the father was never known.{}{}{}{}But when all evils befell us, well, it is known that upior, striga, they live among us and bring bad luck even in life... so anyone who shows signs...'
8835:The ritual binds the creature to your hold. It cannot speak, but you see it is lost, in pain and anger. {}{}{}{}You feel it searching for places of the gods, thrashing towards you as well as their champion, but this is out of despair, not evil.
8836:You know that simply banishing this soul may not work. You must go to its grave site.
8837:Use your hold to destroy the creature. It may not remain dead forever, but this will work for now. 
8838:The villagers lead you to the grave.{}{}{}{}They dig out the body, reluctantly.{}{}{}{}You see a body laid to rest with its head severed and placed between the legs, and its hands tied with red rope.
8839:Lay this body to rest with respect. Place the head where it should be, facing west, and untie the hands. Write the name of the girl on a parchment and bury it with her too, so the spirit may find its way here.
8840:It is unclear why the striga burial did not work. Best to drive an iron nail through the head and spread salt and poppy seeds into the ground, then turn the body over on its belly. That way, it should not rise again, whatever it is.
8841:The creature dissolves screaming and thrashing against an invisible hold.{}{}{}{}The hamlet should remain safe for now. {}{}{}{}The people thank you and give you what they can in reward.
8842:The creature becomes more solid, and a person of unclear gender appears. It looks lost at first, then upon seeing the villagers it twists in anger and pain.
8843:[Elf]Speak to it in the elven tongue to soothe its anger.
8844:This spirit is clearly elven. Alas, you know little of elven burial rites. Offer it some of your own spirit force. That may help to free it from this state.
8845:You know little of elven rites, so lay the body to rest with respect and hope that will help.
8846:The spirit seems to calm itself, and as you continue the burial rites, the soul becomes less and less corporeal until it finally dissolves in the air. {}{}{}{}You are unsure if it is truly free, but it seems at peace for now.{}{}{}{}The villagers too are grateful for your aid.
8847:Take your payment and leave.
8848:You now see this is a part-elven youth. This is why the folk thought them strange and why a striga burial would only trap the eternal spirit here. You tell the spirit you will now set it free, and it looks at you with hope.
8849:Open your own soul and guide this lost spirit towards the elven light.
8850:You give up your own spirit, and indeed the elven soul seems nourished. Its anger slowly subsides. It bows to you and walks away. You feel a blessing befall you in thanks. {}{}{}{}The villagers too are grateful for your aid.
8851:The elven spirit becomes entwined in warm strands of light. You feel the soul released from this corporeal plane and its true essence may now try to reach the western shores for rebirth.{}{}{}{}Some strands touch you as well, and you feel the wisdom of this young-old spirit pass to you.{}{}{}{}The villagers too are grateful for your aid.
8852:The elven spirit becomes entwined in warm strands of light. You feel the soul released from its corporeal chains, and yet, instead of continuing its journey towards rebirth, the spirit forms into a being of light and joins you!{}{}{}{}The villagers too are grateful for your aid.
8853:'The gods, you say? Praise be Lady Luck then.{}{}{}{}Every third night, when the sun sleeps, an unliving corpse comes among us. {}{}{}{}At times it only walks, and wails... It destroyed our chram, and we think it killed our wise one too.'
8854:The prayer works, and your domain binds the creature to your hold. It cannot speak, but you see it is lost, in pain and anger. {}{}{}{}You feel it searching for places of the gods, thrashing towards you as well as their champion, but you also feel this is out of despair, not evil.
8855:The spirit remains elusive. You cannot hold it and you are unsure what kind of spirit it may be. {}{}{}{}The villagers look saddened but not surprised, as if they accept their fate.
8856:Attack the spirit!
8857:Explain that you tried your best, and depart.
8858:You defeat the angry spirit, and the air in the village becomes clearer. {}{}{}{}You think the forlorn soul may someday return, but it is gone for now.{}{}{}{}The villagers are thankful and offer you what they can as payment.
8859:Accept their gifts and leave.
8860:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. You hear the cries of the villagers as you run, and when you look back, the settlement is engulfed in a dark mist.
8861:You defeat the villagers, and any who survived flee and hide. You loot the village, but you sense there is a malevolent presence here, and if you linger too long it may cause you harm.
8862:You are badly beaten and forced to flee and abandon some of your stuff to escape.
8863:'Well, I suppose it may be, you'll see a dead girl comin' and you can try to kill her for us, I mean, make her... more dead?'
8864:On the third night, just as he said, you spot an unliving corpse blundering blindly between the houses. {}{}{}{}Its body flickers from physical to spirit form, and you see no head on its shoulders.
8865:The spirit wails in pain and anguish. It seems bound by chains to the burial ground, thrashing about but unable to move.{}{}{}{}The villagers will likely not have much peace here, but they should be safe, and they thank you for it.{}{}
8866:The debris is too heavy, and it is likely that whatever could hide beneath it has been crushed anyway. 
8867:You come across a small hamlet. Within, you find a group of worried-looking folk gathered around a crying woman.
8868:Ask them what's wrong.
8869:Use this distraction to attack them!
8870:None of your business, really; just leave.
8871:The woman turns to you, hesitant, then looks to others for courage and they nod, so she speaks:{}{}{}{}'It's that useless lump of a husband of mine. He won't leave me alone!'
8872:Ask her why the others will not help. Surely one man isn't that dangerous?
8873:'The bugger had to hold on to grass when he shat, so no, it's not that. He's a dead one, you see. He passed two weeks gone. But he keeps comin' my way, climbing into my bed as if nothin' happened!'
8874:[Zerca or wisdom]Tell her you know of a way to be rid of the apparition, for it is bound to her by marital attachment for sure. Tell her to wear seven dresses.
8875:[Shaman]Tell her spirits are your expertise, and you will speak to this husband of hers.
8876:Say that you are happy to kill the ghost if she likes -- for a price, of course.
8877:'So, you say I should put on seven of my best frocks, then go to sleep as always? {}{}{}{}Seems an odd thing, and I'll have to borrow frocks. You sure about this?'
8878:Nod in confirmation.
8879:The woman reports the next day:{}{}{}{}'Smart one, you are! I did as you asked, wore my seven frocks, and the bugger came and he stands there gawking at me. Seven frocks? - says he with his stupid mouth open wide. Seven, say I.'
8880:Wait to hear the rest.
8881:'He frowns at me - Why, I never saw no woman wearing seven frocks before!{}{}{}{}Why, I never saw a dead husband come into the marital bed before! - say I. And the wretched thing, stumped, goes and disappears!'{}{}{}{}She gives you her family heirloom as reward.
8882:Tell her you were happy to help.
8883:The woman looks unsure.{}{}{}{}'You ghost-meddling folk, you worry me as much as my deadbeat husband.'
8884:Say that in that case, you wish her many more nights with her beloved.
8885:Shrug and say that either she'll take your help, pay for it and be done with it, or you'll happily leave.
8886:In that case, just kill those ungrateful bastards!
8887:Ask why she is so set against spirits. It is still her husband, no?
8888:'No need to get all bothered, sirs. I meant no offendin'. Kill fire with fire's what I say. {}{}{}{}You go speak to that husband of mine. Night is comin', and he will come too.'
8889:Agree and go into her house to talk to the spirit.
8890:'Kill a spirit, will ya? I say good. My husband is gone and done. This thing is no kin of mine. You be careful, though, these things can bring fellow nasties when attacked. It's why we haven't done it ourselves yet.'{}{}{}{}The rest of the villagers nod in agreement.
8891:Stake out the house and attack the ghost when it appears.
8892:You slay the wayward husband-ghost, and the wife throws herself in your arms:{}{}{}{}'Thank you! I don't have much, but here's some food I made, warm and tasty. Just what you need after fightin'.'
8893:Ask for a better reward.
8894:Thank her and move on.
8895:'You cheeky buggers! Help, they say, but our livelihoods is all they want...{}{}{}{}Here, have some gold and choke on it.'{}{}{}{}You get some gold coins, but over the next few days, your throat gets sore and swollen as if you were about to choke.
8896:Damned witch.
8897:'You cheeky buggers! Help, they say, but our livelihoods is all they want...{}{}{}{}Here, have some gold and choke on it.'{}{}
8898:Good, take the gold and leave.
8899:The husband-ghost is ferocious and chases you away from his house!{}{}{}{}The villagers curse you out too, for you only angered the spirit.
8900:Best leave quickly then.
8901:You slay all the settlers without mercy!{}{}{}{}Their hamlet was poor and barely sustainable, but you find some resources you can take. You also find some young children hiding in one of the houses.
8902:Kill them too. No need for enemies later.
8903:Take them in. They are young and will forget.
8904:Leave them in a nearby grove for forest demons to take. Some may get lucky and become something good, and others, well, at least you'll give them a chance.
8905:You slay all the settlers without mercy!{}{}{}{}Their hamlet was poor and barely sustainable, but you find some resources you can take.
8906:The angry mob beats you badly, but they do not pursue as you run away.
8907:'It's unnatural's what it is! And yeah, sure, we live in a place where there be demon folk round every corner, but how's I supposed to know what is evil and what is not? Best just keep away from it all.'
8908:Try to convince her that spirits can be good too and that she should give her husband a chance.
8909:Agree that it is never a clear thing, and offer to solve this problem for her by talking to the ghost.
8910:The husband-ghost is a lean, tired, middle-aged man with a bulging head who looks frail and sickly. {}{}{}{}He stares at you blankly, waiting for his wife to come to bed.{}{}
8911:Ask him why he keeps returning here.
8912:'I was told by my missus to always come home to her bed else she'd hang my precious on the fence. {}{}{}{}You seen her mean face? She do it, she do it even in my death. I ain't losin' my preciousness!'
8913:This ghost will be hard to convince, but try to do so anyway.
8914:Poor thing, just leave him be.
8915:Seems unlikely to leave quietly, so kill him.
8916:You leave the ghost be and while the wife is not happy, she does not say anything.{}{}
8917:'Oh, so my, my things are not, I mean she can't, oh! Great! Finally, I am free, thank you!'{}{}{}{}The ghost disappears and the wife comes in to see your work done.
8918:Tell her she is freed from the ghost.
8919:The wife cries out at night. You run into the bedroom and see the ghost ripping her apart with spectral claws.{}{}{}{}Once she is gone, the spirit dissolves.
8920:Tell the villagers there was no other way. The ghost was too attached to his wife, so he took her with him.
8921:Try to apologise for your error. Mistakes happen, and ghost whispering isn't a precise art.
8922:'Thank you! I don't have much, but here's some food I made, warm and tasty. Just what you need after fightin'.'
8923:'You stop spillin' that filth from your mouth! I ain't sharing my bed with no ghost!'
8924:Just leave her be, then. Not your business.
8925:Offer to speak to the ghost instead.
8926:'Well, he was a bugger, and drunk, but he was mine. I guess I'll give him another go. Thank you for helpin'. Here, have a hot dinner I made - I ain't got much more.''
8927:The villagers are bewildered, but they know better than to question the words of a wise one, especially now that the problem is gone.{}{}{}{}They offer you food in thanks, and you get the feeling that asking for more may be pushing it.
8928:Take the food and leave.
8929:You are woken by a scream and find that a child stands atop one of your teammates, holding a bloodied knife and about to plunge the deadly blow!{}{}{}{}It is one of the children you 'rescued' from a settlement after killing all its folk.
8930:Try to talk this kid down. Explain that you had to kill those villagers because they were weakened by demons.
8931:Intimidate the child. Say that they may get lucky and kill one person, but they will surely die next!
8932:Attack the child before it can do harm!
8933:A deformed, childlike creature creeps up on you as you sleep. {}{}{}{}It croaks:{}{}{}{}'You, you did this to me, you monster! You killed my ma and pa and left me for them demons, and now I am like this!'{}{}{}{}It lunges at you!
8934:Try to convince the child to calm down. Say that you made a mistake and would like them to stay with you and be safe and loved!
8935:'I...I am sorry. I didn't mean to. Please don't hurt me like you hurt my pa...please...'
8936:Say that you will not do them harm as long as they behave from now on.
8937:Kill the child. It is an enemy waiting to strike again.
8938:'You KILLED my pa, you monster!'{}{}{}{}The child stabs wildly and although they have little strength, much blood is drawn.
8939:Grab the child by force and restrain them, but allow them to live on in the hope that they will calm down in time.
8940:You slay the demon child before they are able to utter a curse upon you in full.
8941:'I should leave you to the bies to devour your flesh, just like you left me.{}{}{}{}Instead, I curse you and all your kin!'{}{}{}{}The creature disappears, but a curse lingers upon your souls. 
8942:'You KILLED my pa, you monster!'{}{}{}{}The child stabs wildly, driven even more ferocious by your intimidation attempts.
8943:You let the wronged child live, even after they attacked you viciously and proclaimed revenge upon your kin.
8944:Try to watch out for them in the future.
8945:Your commitment to care for the youth made them forgive your past, and they have truly become your own. {}{}{}{}One day, they bring you a treasure chest, proclaiming that it was their family's secret, but now you are their family so you should have it.
8946:Great. 
8947:Despite your efforts to keep watch, one day you find you were robbed and the child is gone!
8948:Damn.
8949:You run away, but the creature spits burning mud at you, leaving you scarred.
8950:The creature stops and stares at you, its eyes sad and lonely. It nods, more to itself than you, and then it joins you.
8951:The creature stops and stares at you, its eyes sad and lonely. It nods, more to itself than you. It does not attack, but neither does it join you. It only growls:{}{}{}{}'You slaughtered them all, and now you talk of love? I am a better being than this. I leave you to your fate, monster.'{}{}{}{}It walks off into the shadows.
8952:The creature stops and stares at you, its eyes sad and lonely. It nods, more to itself than you. It does not attack, but neither does it join you. It only growls:{}{}{}{}'You slaughtered them all, and now you talk of love? I am a better being than this. I leave you to your fate, monster.'{}{}{}{}It walks off into the shadows, and you feel a heavy curse upon you.
8953:'Surrender! Surrender, like I did as a child. I should leave you to the bies to devour your flesh, just like you left me.{}{}{}{}Instead, I curse you and all your kin!'{}{}{}{}The creature disappears, but a curse lingers upon your souls. 
8954:A group of goblins runs in your direction. They look scared, and it seems they are mostly elders or young ones.{}{}{}{}Still, a few are armed.
8955:Tell them to stop and state what they want.
8956:They comply, but they keep looking behind them nervously. One of them speaks:{}{}{}{}'You, you will not kill us, right? We only want to go, we find a new place, we swear, just let us go!'
8957:Ask what he is talking about.
8958:Shrug and let them pass.
8959:Ask for the short version of what is going on. [Skip story]
8960:'Oh, yes. Sorry. You just look a little like them. I think it's an elf, but may be a thin human...'
8961:Who?
8962:'Goblin killer man! I kid you not, it isn't a mere name. That dude, or lady, they come and they kill and kill and kill. {}{}{}{}They murdered our village whole and then went for the little ones, spouting that they will only grow to become like any of us.'
8963:Do they know why this goblin killer attacked them?
8964:Say that this seems like none of your business, but if they pay, you could deal with the killer.
8965:Tell them it seems dangerous, so they'd better keep running and leave.
8966:'Oh, yes, thank you. But maybe you help us? Maybe kill this psycho? Think of our children!'
8967:Agree to help them stop this threat. Perhaps the goblin killer will listen to reason -- if not, then the blade.
8968:'Well, it is really weird, they keep saying we animals, we destroyed their farm and raped all the women. I mean, sure, we like a bit of big-folk lovin' but we not raid and rape! They must take us for orcs or something.'
8969:Are orcs known for raping after a raid?
8970:So this goblin killer is hunting them now?
8971:'Humans, orcs, sure. Dwarves and elves maybe less, and listen, I'm not sayin' it never happens with our lot. We have bad apples, just like you do. But we not do it all the time, I swear!'
8972:'Oh, yes. Sorry. You don't even look like them at all. I think it's an elf, but may be a thin human?.?.?.'
8973:'You, you will? Thanking you for sure! Yes, we pay, we pay what we can. {}{}{}{}A bit now, a bit when you bring their head to us. Oh, be careful, they come with others sometimes.'
8974:Nod and leave to find this goblin killer.
8975:'Yes, yes, and he comes with friends often, they very bad. I do not know who harmed their family, but it wasn't my kin, I swear!'
8976:[Perception, intelligence, goblin or luck]Try to determine if he is telling the truth.
8977:You see the goblin sweating and averting eye contact with you. Others look equally uncomfortable. He is lying for sure.
8978:Confront him and say he has one chance to tell you the truth!
8979:Attack the lying scum!
8980:'Oh, fine...so it was our boys that did it. We think. I mean, our village was doing bad, crops died, spirits did not help. {}{}{}{}Those boys, they say they go find us stuff. And they did. We did not ask where. But we did know. Maybe not all of it, but how else would they get so much? The raping, though, we really didn't know that. Those boys, they dead now, proper dead. We did not go, we did not kill. Our children, they good, please...'
8981:Tell them you will try to speak to this goblin killer, but you cannot promise anything, since they are guilty in part.
8982:Agree that the whole village should not pay for the actions of some, especially children. Say that you will speak to this goblin killer.
8983:Say that whatever comes their way is well deserved. Leave.
8984:Tell them you will take their children to safety, but the rest should stand and pay the price for their crimes.
8985:They are guilty. Attack!
8986:'Take our children? Never! We will fight and we may die, but we will do it together. If you see us as guilty, then at least let us be. We will try to run.'
8987:Let them run.
8988:'You, you will? Thanking you for sure! Oh, be careful, they come with others sometimes.'
8989:The goblins depart as quickly as they can. Some look at you with gratitude for sparing their lives, some with fear, and others with anger and pain. One of the children waves goodbye and throws a flower as a gift.
8990:The goblins seem nervous. Perhaps they aren't telling you everything.
8991:Ask them again for the truth.
8992:'Oh, yes. Well, we did know the goblins who may have done wrong to that killer. Perhaps that is why he targets us. But he is a monster, we did nothing to him!'
8993:Say that it all seems fishy and they should deal with it themselves. Leave.
8994:'A goblin killer destroyed our village and is hunting us. But maybe you help us? Maybe kill this psycho? Think of our children!'
8995:You kill the goblins and gather the loot.
8996:'Oi, you same as that psychopath. You go die, we run.'{}{}{}{}The goblins rush off and leave you on the ground.
8997:You come across an armed group of fighters. There is a human wearing a helmet, a tall, hooded orc with a bone wand, a zerca, an elf, and a dwarf.{}{}The human has goblin heads on his belt, so this must be the crazed goblin killer you were told about.{}{}{}{}They look you up and down but do not speak. 
8998:Ask them what they want.
8999:Get off their path and leave.
9000:You come across an armed group of fighters. There is a human wearing a helmet, a tall, hooded orc with a bone wand, a zerca, an elf, and a dwarf.{}{}The human has goblin heads on his belt, so this must be the crazed goblin killer you were told about.{}{}{}{}They look at you and spit: 'Goblin scum, come to us? Good.'{}{}{}{}They ready themselves for an attack.
9001:Stand between them and your goblin friend and tell them to calm themselves -- there is no need for violence here. 
9002:You kill the notorious goblin slayer, and for a time, you receive letters of thanks from various goblin survivors. Some even send gifts.
9003:You are defeated, and any greenskins in your party do not make it out alive.
9004:'Speak quickly, goblin lover. Did you see a band of the green scum running this way?'
9005:Deny that you saw anything. 
9006:Say that you did see them, but you did not want to get involved, so you let them run.
9007:Say that you did see them and you killed them.
9008:'Fine, we will leave you be. But you are making a mistake with the goblin. The greenskins will always trick you. No better than vermin.'
9009:[Rat]!!!
9010:Ask why they hate goblins so. You've never known them to be any more or less violent than humans.
9011:The warrior does not answer, only looks away, searching for goblin tracks. The priest speaks instead:{}{}{}{}'Bah, you clearly have very little sense when it comes to friends. No matter. I need to catch the ones that got away. Begone from our path.'
9012:The man in the helmet does not answer, but his elven companion speaks:{}{}{}{}'As a mere child, our friend witnessed their home burned and pillaged, and a sister raped. Goblins were the culprits. Ever since, they have become an enemy. We trust our friend, so we give aid. Perhaps there is truth in their words. Goblins pretend to be weak and nice, but they always plot, scheme, meddle with evil spirits, and seek to spread darkness.'
9013:Say that this is none of your concern and depart. 
9014:[Hunter]Offer to tell them which way the goblins went.
9015:Tell them you understand grief, but murdering every goblin they meet seems extreme.
9016:The band does not listen. One of them shouts:{}{}{}{}'Goblins must die!'{}{}{}{}They begin to move, trying to circle you.
9017:Run away, accepting that you will likely be hit by the elven archer as you escape.
9018:'Speak quickly. Did you see a band of the green scum running this way?'
9019:'Oh. Disappointing for me, but dead is dead. Good.'{}{}{}{}One of the others continues:{}{}{}{}'The little shits raped and killed their dear sister. Been tracking them for years. Sneaky buggers. None deserves to live. That tribe, they worship some dark deity, want darkness to come back so humans lose again.'{}{}{}{}The warrior in the helmet spits and the others nod solemnly.
9020:Shrug and say it is none of your business, but the goblins are dead. Any reward?
9021:Nod and say in that case you did a good deed, right?
9022:Tell them you understand grief, but murdering every goblin they meet seems extreme. Then again, you did it too, so who are you to judge?
9023:The warrior nods and hands you their weapon:{}{}{}{}'Here.'{}{}{}{}The priest lets out a sigh and speaks up: 'You're not getting more words out of that one. We thank you. Your deed was good. Be well, and stay wary of the greenskins.'
9024:The warrior speaks:{}{}{}{}'Yes, the children grow, hate, become adult goblins, and seek revenge. If I kill, I must kill all.'{}{}{}{}The priest looks uncomfortable but remains silent.
9025:The warrior nods and hands you their weapon:{}{}{}{}'Yes.' He then hands you a cage with an animal inside. 'For killing more greenskins.'{}{}{}{}The priest lets out a sigh and speaks up: 'You're not getting more words out of that one. We thank you. Your deed was good. Be well, and stay wary of the greenskins.'
9026:The warrior nods and speaks:{}{}{}{}'That was stupid. They will run, grow. More killing.'{}{}{}{}An uncomfortable silence falls over the group, and one of the companions speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Better just leave now, goblin lover.'
9027:Move away from them.
9028:Affirm that it was none of your concern, and you also did not aid the goblins -- merely let them go.
9029:'You lie. You walk with them and lie for them. Foolish.'{}{}{}{}An uncomfortable silence falls over the group, and one of the companions speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Better just leave now, goblin lover.'{}{}{}{}They depart and you realise later that one of their mages has cursed you.
9030:The warrior looks at you for a time, then nods again:{}{}{}{}'Yes. Foolish, but perhaps better. They could have harmed you. We will leave now. Do not trust them.'{}{}
9031:'Yes, good. Here.'{}{}{}{}The warrior hands you payment for the information, and the band moves out in a hunting formation.
9032:Wish them luck and leave.
9033:They watch you move, then depart also, and you realise later that one of their mages has cursed you.
9034:The warrior speaks:{}{}{}{}'The children grow, hate, become adult goblins, and seek revenge. If I kill, I must kill all.'{}{}{}{}The priest looks uncomfortable but remains silent. The others nod.
9035:[Turmoil]Agree with his point of view. An enemy left alive is an enemy forever in the shadows. Wish them good hunting.
9036:[Harmony]Tell them that their hateful path will lead only to more death. If those goblins are indeed in league with darkness, they need to be stopped. But killing young ones in pre-emptive action will never be good.
9037:They do not reply, but you see one of the mages about to cast a spell your way, before stopping and putting their wand away. {}{}{}{}The band moves out.
9038:The priest breaks down in tears, mumbling 'I told you so,' and 'damnation.'{}{}{}{}The warrior looks very uncomfortable and turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Now you've done it. You talk like this, but when they bring darkness, your gods will ask us to do something. {}{}{}{}But I will spare the green children, for now. Happy?'{}{}{}{}The question was clearly more for the priest than for you. The zerca nods and the band moves away.
9039:Ask if they are the ones chasing a group of goblins.
9040:[Goblin]Murdering scum. Attack them!
9041:Say that you know what the goblins did to their family, but surely the whole village does not need to pay for it, at least not with death?
9042:The goblins did not tell you this. Offer to reveal which way they went.
9043:Try to convince them to let this go. Surely children can be spared?
9044:[Turmoil]Agree with his point of view. An enemy left alive is an enemy forever in the shadows. Wish them good hunting and point them to where the goblins went.
9045:'Yes. You have seen them? Where?'
9046:[Intelligence]Tell them you killed the goblins.
9047:Ask them why they are chasing mere children and elders. Surely destroying their village was enough.
9048:The warrior nods and grunts:{}{}{}{}'Yes.' He then hands you a cage with an animal inside. 'For killing more greenskins.'{}{}{}{}The priest lets out a sigh and speaks up:{}{}{}{} 'You're not getting more words out of that one. We thank you. Your deed was good. Be well, and stay wary of the greenskins.'
9049:'Yes. This once, I will leave them be. But if they grow to kill and bring darkness, you will bear the blame also.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
9050:Say that it is the right thing to do. The cycle of violence should end. Wish them well and leave.
9051:'Yes, you understand. Here.'{}{}{}{}The warrior hands you payment for the information, and the band moves out in a hunting formation.
9052:Say that it is the only right thing to do for harmony.
9053:'So it was them, good. I was not certain. Now, did you see where they went? They will pay.'
9054:Yes, tell them where the goblins went.
9055:The goblins find you later and thank you for giving them time to run. They found some kin and together they leave you a reward.
9056:You arrive in the volcanic lands, so named for the many active volcanoes and lava pits. {}{}{}{}From the ash-covered plains and burned-out drylands to the high peaks of the volcanic mountains, the ever-hot, stifling air and constant threat of eruption keeps the wildlife and any mad settlers on their toes.
9057:Disembark.
9058:This harsh, unforgiving land is home to the alpha clans, who enjoy the daily challenge of the environment. {}{}{}{}You can also find lava trolls and even the occasional dragon lurking amongst the molten rocks.{}{}{}{}This land is rich in obsidian and other rocks, and beetle jelly is the local specialty.
9059:You have arrived in the lands of darkness. Here the last remnants of the deadly black mist remain ever-lingering and the sun is constantly dimmed, creating a feeling of perpetual dusk.{}{}{}{}Beware of night terrors and creatures of the dark skulking in every corner.
9060:Despite its dangers, the land of darkness is home to the spirit talkers, goblin tribes that feel at ease in the dark and take advantage of the thinned veil between this world and the greyworld of the spirits.{}{}{}{}The shadowkin, a more elusive and dangerous faction of those changed by darkness long ago, lurks in the shadows.{}{}{}{}The island is known for dragon bones and mushrooms.
9061:You have arrived in the ice lands, the forever-frozen pastures ruled by the mysterious dziad mroz. {}{}{}{}When the cold swallowed this island, cities fell into instant ruin and folk fled, unable to live in such a harsh environment.
9062:You will not find many creatures alive here, but the ice demons are known to make lairs from time to time. {}{}{}{}Dziad mroz is a creature who is many but one. You can also find the terrifying ice trolls, whimsical sniezynka, or mischievous icicles roaming the ice plains or hiding amongst the mountain peaks. {}{}{}{}You may find diamonds and nuts here.{}{}
9063:You have arrived on the fabled ancient forest island. It is said that this land emerged from hiding when the earth shattered, much like the cities of the dwarves. {}{}{}{}Much of the woodland here has been destroyed, but what remains is no less breathtaking.
9064:These lands are home to the elder races. Both woodlandkin and forest demons stand as guardians of the evergreen woodlands, hoping to one day regrow what was lost.{}{}{}{}Creatures of the forest are fiercely territorial, so one should remain on guard. {}{}{}{}Ancient wood and exotic spices can be found here.
9065:You have arrived in the metallic lands, an unforgiving region of stone and metal. When the Shattering unearthed the ancient dwarven cities, the land around them changed. Even trees became hollow husks of iron, and grass fossilised into rock. 
9066:This foreboding land is the home to the earthbound, who were forced out of their underground kingdoms. The earthbound are a proud people, protective of their privacy. {}{}{}{}The land of metal and stone is also home to rock trolls and dragons, so it is not for the faint of heart. {}{}{}{}You can gather mithril and eggs here.
9067:You allowed your chosen to die! Without the divine bond, you will no longer have any power or influence over the world, and thus your reign will end.{}{}{}{}You have one more chance to remain in the game. Call upon the spirit of the cosmic tree itself and ask for the soul of your chosen to be returned to you. {}{}{}{}Remember, the price is high and it will get higher every time you abuse your divine power like this. 
9068:You paid your bloody dues and the spirit of your chosen is returned. Now pray that it comes back in the right flesh?.?.?.
9069:The skies darken, birds fly low, and there's an air of anticipation around you.
9070:Brace yourself.
9071:A loud thud followed by tremors catches you in the mountains. An avalanche is likely to follow.
9072:[Dwarf]The mountains are your domain. Seek cover.
9073:[Vily or viatroviec]As the wind is your friend, fly to safety with your kin.
9074:Try to outrun it.
9075:Scout a safe place to hide out.
9076:[Orc]The mountains are your domain. Seek cover.
9077:With your expert eye, you find the perfect spot to wait out the coming avalanche. {}{}{}{}Afterwards, you are able to gather some good minerals from the rubble.{}{}
9078:Gather the stone and leave.
9079:You fly to safety before the avalanche gets you, and as it subsides, you spot a group of dead travellers who were not so lucky. {}{}
9080:Give them a quick burial and gather their things.
9081:With your expert eye and intuition, you find a cave to wait out the coming avalanche. {}{}{}{}Alas, the entrance was not as strong as you judged, and it collapses under the weight of the avalanche. Now you must dig your way out.
9082:Dig out.
9083:You dig your way out and even find some good minerals on your way.
9084:You eventually dig your way out, but it is a tiresome ordeal. 
9085:By the skin of your teeth, you manage to make a safe run for it.
9086:The avalanche hits strong and fast, threatening to swallow you whole. You manage to find shelter at the last minute, but now you must dig your way out from under the rubble.
9087:The avalanche hits strong and fast, threatening to swallow you whole. {}{}{}{}You manage to run away, but not without losing some of your heavier gear.
9088:You find a cave to wait out the coming avalanche. {}{}{}{}Alas, the entrance was not as strong as you judged, and it collapses under the weight of the avalanche. Now you must dig your way out.
9089:You find a ledge where you wait out the avalanche. Alas, the way back up was damaged, and it will be very tricky to find a safe path back.
9090:Plan a safe route. 
9091:You carefully plan every step and make it back up safe and sound. 
9092:You try to carefully plan every step and make it back up safe and sound. But some of your steps are badly chosen, and some of your equipment falls down the mountain.
9093:With your pure instinct, you find the perfect spot to wait out the coming avalanche. {}{}{}{}Afterwards, you are able to gather some good minerals from the rubble.{}{}
9094:You try to fly away before the avalanche hits, but you are swept up in the gust of wind that follows. {}{}{}{}You get away, but not without scrapes and bruises.{}{}
9095:A sudden storm catches you off guard. Lightning bolts cut through the sky and gusts of wind sweep you off your feet. {}{}
9096:[Turmoil]In the name of turmoil's raging power, embrace this storm and ask for the thunder's blessing!
9097:[Nature or Intellect]Respect nature's anger and seek shelter as fast as you can. 
9098:Take cover.
9099:Try to outrun the storm.
9100:You spot a cave that will protect you, but first you must reach it!
9101:You run like the wind and feel that the gods look favourably on you.
9102:You run like the wind and feel that the gods look favourably on you. The cave keeps you safe, and when you leave, you discover some stone and the remains of a less fortunate soul.
9103:You make it to the cave, but the cold wind and drenching rain seep into this all-too-shallow cover. You end up feeling ill. 
9104:Lightning strikes at your feet and you smell your own burned skin and hair. Yet you feel a surge of power run through you!
9105:Praise the gods and leave.
9106:Lightning strikes at your feet and you smell your own burned skin and hair.{}{}
9107:As your domain guides you, you sharpen your minds and find good shelter quickly, knowing that such thunderstorms can be deadly to the unwise.{}{}
9108:As you camp by the water, a flash flood rises unexpectedly!
9109:[Water demon]Ride out the flood.
9110:Try to find higher ground. 
9111:You ride the violent waves as if you were made for it.{}{}{}{}Afterwards, you find some resources that were thrown out onto the shore.
9112:You ride the violent waves as if you were made for it, but lady nature is angry today and you find it hard to hold on.
9113:Fight the waves.
9114:The waters will not be tamed, and you know well enough not to try your luck further. {}{}{}{}You find shelter, but not before the waves bash you against the rugged depths and hard shore.{}{}
9115:You find an old, sturdy oak and climb it. {}{}{}{}Some useful resources also wash up on the shore.
9116:You run up towards a hill that will protect you, but you have to drop some things to escape the flood. {}{}{}{}Some debris washes on the shore afterwards. 
9117:You are close enough to a hill to reach it in time, although you are drenched and tired and will likely catch a cold.{}{}{}{}Some debris washes up on the shore afterwards. 
9118:You stay strong and the waters yield to you, keeping you safe and invigorated.{}{}{}{}Afterwards, you find some resources that were thrown onto the shore.
9119:A sudden blizzard engulfs you in its icy clutches!
9120:[Ice demon]Absorb the icy snow so it cannot do any harm. 
9121:Try to push through it.
9122:Use some of your wood supply to quickly strengthen your shelter.
9123:[Dziad mroz]Tell the blizzard to cease, now. 
9124:You embrace the blizzard and absorb the snow, which strengthens you. 
9125:You embrace the blizzard and absorb the snow, but the cold cuts deep and you may find it hard to withstand the pressure. 
9126:Stand firm.
9127:Despite the unexpected force of the blizzard, you persevere and protect your surroundings. {}{}{}{}You discover the body of a less fortunate soul to loot.
9128:The blizzard proves too strong. You get nasty frostbite and will likely fall ill from the cold. 
9129:You strengthen your camp with the wood and burn a fire to keep you warm.{}{}{}{}The blizzard also uncovered a small supply of minerals. {}{}
9130:Gather the minerals and leave.
9131:You power through the snow and ice and make it to safety. {}{}{}{}You discover the body of a less fortunate soul to loot.{}{}{}{}
9132:The blizzard obeys and moves away.
9133:The blizzard proves too strong. You get nasty frostbite and will likely fall ill from the cold, but luckily you have enough herbs to lessen the spread and strength of the illness. 
9134:A sudden gust of wind heralds the coming of a dirt storm. 
9135:Push your way through.
9136:Try to find shelter and set up camp to hide from the dirt storm.
9137:[Scavengers]Your people roam the plains in search of the next opportunity. Find your way to safety quickly.
9138:[Orc]Your people lived on the plains for decades before settling in the volcanic domains. Seek cover as fast as you can.
9139:You quickly seek out a hollow to lie in and wait the dirt storm out. {}{}{}{}It seems like the place you stumbled upon is a beast cemetery, so you may also find some good bones here. 
9140:Gather the bones and leave.
9141:You dig your way out and discover more than dirt blocked your escape.
9142:The tunnel is dark and narrow. The dirt seeps in like water, and you cough and choke. {}{}{}{}You dig your way out eventually, but the ordeal is exhausting.
9143:The dirt gets in everywhere. You choke and struggle, but you persevere and come out stronger for it.
9144:You find a good spot and set up a strong camp that withstands the sandstorm. {}{}{}{}You also find the wind has blown some remains for you to loot. 
9145:Gather the stuff and leave.
9146:The dirt gets in everywhere. You choke and struggle, and when you eventually come out to safety, you realise you lost several bags in the storm.{}{}
9147:You find shelter in some old tunnels unearthed in the Shattering, but the dirt storm is so severe, you need to dig your way back out.
9148:You smell smoke and feel a heat wave coming your way. It's a fire!
9149:[Nature or Harmony]Call upon harmony and nature to ask for rain to soothe this blaze before lives are lost. 
9150:[Forest demon]Command the forest to help you fight the fire. 
9151:[Elf]Ask the forest to aid you in fighting this fire.
9152:Try to put out the fire with water from the nearby pond and sand that surrounds it. 
9153:The skies darken, clouds amass, and soothing rain falls upon the raging fire. {}{}{}{}
9154:The forest wakes and moves away from the flame's path so the blaze gradually fizzles out. {}{}{}{}Within the burnt areas, you discover the remains of some less fortunate souls. 
9155:Give them a burial and gather their belongings.
9156:The forest responds. It will aid you, but you must still fight hard to stop this raging blaze.{}{}
9157:Put the fire out.
9158:The forest is saved, and you feel its gratitude fall upon you. {}{}{}{}You can also gather up some of the wood now. 
9159:Despite your best efforts, the blaze engulfs the forest, and you are forced to flee before it kills you as well.{}{}{}{}Some of your equipment is scorched in the flames.
9160:You run away, and the forest burns behind you.
9161:You run away in time. The forest burns, and, in the ashes, you find the remains of less fortunate souls.
9162:You barely escape the blazing fire, but not without losing some bags on the way.
9163:The path you were on seemed solid and safe, but you realise too late that you stepped into quicksand.
9164:Scout a safe route through the quicksand.
9165:Try to backtrack quickly.
9166:You manage to turn back onto solid ground, but you lose some bags on the way.{}{}
9167:You manage to turn back onto solid ground, and the struggle against the quicksand strengthened you.
9168:You do not see a safe path through the quicksand -- at least, not one that is straightforward. But you do see a pattern of rocks spread out in front of you. Some of them seem solid and stable, and others become submerged from time to time.{}{}
9169:Figure out the correct path.
9170:Make a quick dash for it.
9171:You make it safely onto solid ground again, and along the path you discover the remains of a less fortunate soul, perhaps spat out from the sands. {}{}
9172:Gather their things and leave.
9173:You find a safe path and follow it without incident.{}{}{}{}You discover the remains of a less fortunate soul, perhaps spat out from the sands. {}{}
9174:You manage to make your way onto solid ground, but you lose some bags on the way and you feel weakened from the ordeal.
9175:You dash quickly from rock to rock and onto solid ground again.{}{}{}{}You discover the remains of a less fortunate soul, perhaps spat out from the sands. {}{}
9176:The air around you gets hotter, the ground trembles, and geysers of hot lava shoot out all around you!
9177:[Orc]Use your instincts to lead a way through the lava pits.
9178:[Dwarf]You've dealt with lava pits in the mountains. Use your knowledge to find a safe path.
9179:[Dwarf]You've dealt with lava pits in the mountains. You see a path through some solid rock, but it will require jumping.
9180:[Lava rockers]Take a lava bath before moving on.
9181:Run as fast you can.
9182:Try to tough it out as you move forwards.
9183:You skilfully avoid lava spills and even find some good stone on your way to safety.
9184:You barely make it through, and you were forced to abandon some bags so as not to fall into the molten lava. 
9185:You find a good path, but it leads through a series of rocks that you need to jump on without falling into pits.
9186:Take the path.
9187:You skilfully avoid lava spills and even find some gems on your way to safety.
9188:The path you find is perilous, but for you it is a sign of strength to push through it. You are forced to sacrifice some of your goods to avoid falling into pits, but just as you suspected, you find a vein of gemstones hidden within the pits. 
9189:You breathe in the lava and it gives you strength. You also fish out some good stones.
9190:The hot air and lava burn your skin, but you brace yourself and  avoid the worst of the lava spills and even find some good stone on your way to safety.{}{}{}{}
9191:A hurricane engulfs you!
9192:[Stribog]Demand that the wind cease, now!
9193:[Wind demons]Rejoice in the wind. Take to the skies and redirect the hurricane so it does not harm your kin.
9194:Try to find shelter quickly.
9195:You fly with the wind and feel its cold yet vibrant embrace.{}{}{}{}You command the force of nature to steer away from your path, and it does so willingly. You are able to collect leavings from those who did not withstand the power.
9196:You fly with the wind and feel its cold yet vibrant embrace. {}{}{}{}You command the force of nature to steer away from your path, but it does not obey fully. You must brace yourself or you'll be swept away. 
9197:The hurricane finally bends to your will and moves on.
9198:You find a crack in the earth where you can wait the hurricane out, but it will take effort to hold steady.
9199:Stay strong.
9200:You find a crack in the earth where you can wait the hurricane out.{}{}{}{}And you are in luck, as you have folk strong enough to run fast to get there and hold steady.  
9201:You manage to stay in place and the hurricane passes, leaving some debris behind.
9202:Gather the debris and leave.
9203:You barely hold on as the winds thrash you about. You lose some of your goods, but at least you're alive.
9204:As a champion of Stribog, you raise your arms and command the wind to obey your master. {}{}{}{}At first you are swept up and carried by the winds as if to your death, but then you feel the embrace of your god within, and the hurricane surrenders to your command and subsides entirely. {}{}{}{}You are strengthened and free to collect the debris.
9205:The forest is saved, and you feel its gratitude fall upon you. You can also gather up some of the wood now. 
9206:You spot a spider's nest nearby. It looks very busy and you think you saw the creatures carrying large cocoons inside.
9207:[Spider queen]Intimidate the nest.
9208:[Beast]Communicate with the nest.
9209:[Druid]Be like a beast and speak to the spiders.
9210:The spiders are somewhat sentient. Beast to beast, you learn that they raided a nearby village and brought a lot of 'juicy' prizes back to the nest.{}{}{}{}Since they are trying to establish their settlement as more than a nest, they agree to give you some loot in exchange for leaving them alone. They also offer to trade.{}{}
9211:Accept their goods and leave.
9212:Accept their goods and trade also.
9213:They killed a whole village. Attack!
9214:As spider queen, you claim dominance over this mere nest. You order the workers to abandon this site and never return to your territory. They obey.{}{}{}{}Within the nest you find less fortunate folk wrapped in cocoons.{}{}{}{}It is unlikely any of them are still alive, but it's worth checking. 
9215:One of the spiders decides to follow you now. Leave together.
9216:Check the cocoons, gather what you can, and leave.
9217:You destroy the nest and inside, you find less fortunate folk wrapped in cocoons.{}{}{}{}It is unlikely any of them are still alive, but it's worth checking. 
9218:You failed to communicate successfully. The nest is agitated and ready to swarm you.
9219:The spiders are somewhat sentient. Beast to beast, you learn that they raided a nearby village and brought a lot of 'juicy' prizes back to the nest.{}{}{}{}Since they are trying to establish their settlement as more than a nest, they offer some goods and say that one of their own will join you as a start to good relations.{}{}
9220:Accept their goodwill and leave.
9221:The ground beneath your feet collapses and you fall into a tunnel. You soon realise the floor seems to be moving. It's swarming with vermin!
9222:Observe the rats. It seems odd that they do not attack you.
9223:[Beastmaster or beast]Try to dominate this swarm to do your bidding!
9224:The rats fall in line or run off, considering your stature. Soon the nest lies empty for you to loot. 
9225:The rats swarm you and bite angrily, squeaking that they have a master already.{}{}
9226:The rat nest is mostly a pile of dung and debris, but you may be able to salvage some goods.
9227:You climb up but realise you were bitten by rats and the wounds are infected.
9228:The rats are not having any of it. They swarm you and you are forced to drop some cargo as you run away.
9229:You are badly beaten and forced to abandon some of your things as you run away.
9230:The rats seem single-mindedly obsessed with carrying objects deeper into the tunnel. Things like branches, stones, pieces of bodies, bones, and equipment. You also may have spotted a person being carried away by the swarm.{}{}{}{}Some of the rats begin tugging at your feet as if to carry you too, but for now they judge it too hard of a task.
9231:[Rat]Stop a group and question them.
9232:Follow the rats. 
9233:[Druid]Become like a rat and speak to them.
9234:Farther into the tunnel, you see an obese rat slumped on a throne made of rat droppings, bones, and odd bits. {}{}{}{}Smaller rats swarm around the seat and add new layers.
9235:[Druid]Try talking to the fat rat. It looks at least partly sentient.
9236:[Witch]Try to dominate the rat. The vermin should be your familiars, not sitting on thrones.
9237:'Da boss, man, da boss is hungry, da boss needs stuff for his shiny sit, so we all be strong and deal with ya big folk out there... yes, yes... You rat, you friend, you no tell boss we let tunnels collapse, we give you stuff, yes, yes?'{}{}
9238:Stare at them menacingly.
9239:'Oyoyoy... you big boss too... you take out prize, a great enemy, we found it, we got it, you have it, you go, you not kill us, you not tell our boss, yes, yes?'
9240:The rats fall in line or run off, considering your stature. Soon the nest lies empty for you to loot. {}{}{}{}The fat rat in charge bows to your superiority and will follow your lead.
9241:You spot a place of interest.
9242:After a violent storm, many trees lie fallen. You see a swarm of crows circling one such tree, and when you get closer, you realise their nest has also fallen, and the birds are trying to move what they can to another tree.
9243:[Perception or hunter] You know the nests of giant crows can hide many treasures within. Go in closer to investigate.
9244:[Leshy]The tree isn't entirely collapsed. Sing to it and restore it to its former self, thus saving the nest too.
9245:Out of respect for nature, wait until the crows rescue their young, then investigate.
9246:Convince the crows to let you help with the move -- for a price.
9247:You get in closer and see the debris from the fallen nest. There are several dead chicks, but also many shiny baubles woven into the structure. {}{}{}{}The tree itself is also of good quality.{}{}{}{}The crows continue ferrying the goods somewhere up high.
9248:Wait till they finish and gather what is left behind. 
9249:Sneak up on them between their runs to steal some goods. 
9250:You wait until the chicks are rescued and fly away with the stronger crows. A small group of stragglers remains to clear the nest. Now it is a matter of the strongest taking the spoils. 
9251:Attack the weaker crows now.
9252:There is little left to gather, but you discover a wounded crow, and when you heal it, the bird decides to follow your path.
9253:You defeat the crows and loot the nest in peace.{}{}
9254:You sneak up and manage to snatch some goods without the crows' knowledge. After they leave for good, you also gather the remaining wood.
9255:The crows saw you coming and attacked, forcing you to drop some goods.
9256:You whisper in the ancient spirit tongue of the trees, and the old oak stands anew. With the crows' nest back in the crown, the crows begin rebuilding it. {}{}{}{}One of them drops a gift in thanks.
9257:The gift turns out to be a crow to serve you. Leave.
9258:Alas, the tree was too weak to heed your call. It withered away despite your attempt to help.{}{}{}{}You feel greatly saddened by this, but the crows seem to leave you be for now.
9259:The crows agree to your terms. After you help them secure the nest, they leave you gifts in thanks.
9260:The angry murder of crows chases you away, forcing you to drop some of your goods to save your lives.
9261:You discover a wounded crow, and when you heal it, the bird decides to follow your path.{}{}
9262:You uncover some underground tunnels.
9263:Throw in some torches first, then investigate.
9264:Go in and investigate.
9265:The tunnels were used for a hideout once, or perhaps they are the remnants of a dwarven outpost. Either way, there are clearly some resources here. {}{}{}{}However, you see a nest of vipers sprawling inside, and they see you!
9266:[Druid]Calm these snakes end explore the chamber.
9267:[Beastmaster]Take out the flute and play.
9268:The tunnels were used for a hideout once, or perhaps they are the remnants of a dwarven outpost. Either way, there are clearly some resources here. {}{}{}{}However, you see a nest of vipers sprawling inside.
9269:Use the advantage of surprise and attack!
9270:Think of a way to outsmart the vipers.
9271:Retreat.
9272:You stand before the snakes and stretch out your arm, clenching your fist. Then, slowly, you straighten one finger and begin marking circles in the air while whispering in the slithering sound of snake speech. {}{}{}{}The snakes are mesmerised, and you are free to loot this place.{}{}
9273:One of the snakes slithers after you. Leave together.
9274:You stand before the snakes and stretch out your arm, clenching your fist. Then, slowly, you straighten one finger and begin marking circles in the air while whispering in the slithering sound of snake speech.{}{}{}{}The snakes seem entranced for a time, but one of them breaks concentration and snaps at you. Others will follow soon!
9275:With the snakes gone, you are free to loot the place.
9276:You climb back up, but not without a few bites from the snakes.
9277:The snakes prove too strong. They swarm you and force you to flee. 
9278:With the right herbs and plants, and a bit of ingenuity, you smoke the snakes out of the tunnel. You are even able to hunt some as they try slithering away in a panic.
9279:You try to smoke the snakes out, but that only enrages them. They swarm you and force you to retreat.
9280:The old goblin traditions of rat catchers live strong in you. Your flute mesmerises the snakes, and you are free to loot the place.
9281:The trader's stalls stand open for you{}{}{}{}
9282:'You are no friends of ours, so you will pay extra.'
9283:'You waste our time, go.'
9284:You enter the territory claimed by the night demons. You see werewolves and strigas skulk in the shadows, watching you with hungry eyes:{}{}{}{}'Have you come to offer your tasty blood, or flesh maybe?'
9285:[Horz or Zorya] As masters of moon and the stars, claim your affinity with the children of the night.
9286:[Friend or night demon] Say that you accept any dangers that may befall you here and would like to enter regardless.
9287:You enter the territory claimed by the night demons. You feel many eyes upon you and a deep growl greets you:{}{}{}{}'Have you come to feed our bloodlust, enemy of the night?'{}{}{}{}
9288:The inhabitants of this place begin circling you and you feel terribly exposed to their hunger.{}{}{}{}'You carry much silver,  mithril, or other material that was borne of the faul metals that hurt us  and come here.  Leave.'
9289:'You are friends, for now. So, you may enter at your own peril.'
9290:Ask around for anything of interest.
9291:There are some werewolves in a fighting ring, go see them.
9292:Visit the pleasure houses.
9293:'I accept your offering and will summon the unliving to your service.'
9294:The night beasts are brawling to prove their worth. You are welcome to join if you dare.{}{}{}{}Close by, a striga master is showing off his mystical powers.
9295:[One time only] Test your brawn against a werewolf. Two of your strongest will fight.
9296:[One time only] Test your brawn against a werewolf.  One of your strongest will fight.
9297:You have either exhausted your chances for a challenge, or this just isn't your time. Go back.
9298:[One time only] Challenge the striga master, one on one.
9299:'It is your lucky day, you may enter, at your own risk.'
9300:The pleasure house is busy, come back later.
9301:You enter the dark rooms of the pleasure house and an exotic dancer that seems part spirit part flesh entertains you. {}{}{}{}Your spirt is restored but you feel some of your blood was drained and this left you ailing.
9302:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'... but you do feel renewed. 
9303:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'... You do not feel very well, but it was certainly a night to remember, or was it?
9304:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'... And one wolf seems to now think you're its daddy.
9305:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'... and when you look down at yourself - you're a striga!
9306:The night demons are slain and you hear a dreadful howling in the distance...{}{}{}{}But then again, you are chosen of Horz, an alpha of the moon. it is your right to claim these beasts if you so wish and you know those who witnessed it will respect you.
9307:The night beasts defeat you and claim their blood price for your attack.
9308:'No, leave. Return with those who are friends of the night, perhaps then we will listen.'
9309:'It is your lucky day, you call nature your master and we respect that. You may enter, at your own risk.'
9310:From within the shadows they speak to you:{}{}{}{}'You are chosen of the night. We want to be in your pack.'
9311:The night demons are slain and you hear a dreadful howling in the distance...
9312:The werewolf yields to your strength and gives you trophies as reward for your victory. {}{}{}{}His pack howls in your honour.
9313:Offer to drink with your opponent for a battle well fought.
9314:Ask for one of you to be turned into a child of the moon like him!
9315:Night demons gather and bow before your challenge. A werewolf enters the ring and bares his razor-sharp teeth in an invitation.
9316:Begin.
9317:You are defeated and must bow down to the victor. {}{}{}{}'You fought well, but you are yet be a true night child. Now, if you still stand, let us drink together!'
9318:Drink if you still can...
9319:One of the challengers wakes with the next full moon as child of the night!
9320:Praise Horz. 
9321:'Agreed, you deserve to join our ranks, for Horz!'{}{}{}{}One of the challengers wakes with the next full moon as child of the night!
9322:'You give up? Coward. Begone from my sight.'
9323:Ask to be turned into a child of the moon like him!
9324:There is a necromancer staying in the settlement. They can offer you your very own unliving companion, for a price.
9325:Offer some pets as payment (you need to have 15).
9326:Offer a child.
9327:Offer a party member, including adults.
9328:'Hmm, not my typical price, but I will accept it, this once.'
9329:'You have enchanted my heart with your masterful skill. I bow to your superior power and your baffling beauty. {}{}{}{}Will you agree to me my mistress of the night? One sweet bite and your world will become changed forever!'
9330:[Elf] Alas, elves cannot accept such dark gifts. Thank him all the same.
9331:Accept the offer.
9332:Decline politely and leave.
9333:'Challenge me? How delightful. Let us dance my dear.'
9334:'Ah, yes, children of light. Such a shame, still. I am enamoured and so shall gift you a servant so they may remind you of me. From now on, you shall be able to summon a werewolf mutt and he will be your to command. Now fare thee well, my love!'
9335:Thank him and leave, this is getting awkward. 
9336:You become the mistress of the night. The striga master is exhausted from the ritual, so it is a good time to go.
9337:Leave, but promise to visit...
9338:'Wonderful, yes, your power is great and I am impressed. I bow to your superiority, friend. Here, a reward for your challenge.'
9339:Ask to be turned into a striga master!
9340:Ask to be turned into a common striga.
9341:'Yes, you shall become a brother of mine. Agreed.'
9342:'Yes, you shall become a child of mine. Agreed.'
9343:'And so, you bow down to my superior power, good...
9344:Accept your defeat. 
9345:'Despite your failure, you have enchanted my heart  with your baffling beauty. You will be my mistress of the night. One sweet bite and your world will become changed forever!'{}{}{}{}You become the mistress of the night. The striga master is exhausted from the ritual, so it is a good time to go.
9346:You don't seem to have too much choice. Nod.
9347:'Also, you shall become a child of mine and serve the night.'
9348:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'... and when you look down at yourself - you're a werewolf!
9349:You got drunk in a night demon pleasure house, when you wake, you are covered in wolf fur and rather rough 'love bites'.
9350:'You have proven friendly to us so far, yes, we will trade with you.'
9351:'Yes, the night mates, bonded forever and you call one of them your alpha, good. Enter, enjoy the night!'
9352:A few children of the night keep watching you. Approach them.
9353:'No deal, time to depart?'
9354:Someone you once lost to the night demons has returned to you, albeit, changed.
9355:Take them with you and leave.
9356:'Ah, it seems you were only able to become a lesser child of the night, still, we are bound now!'
9357:'Agreed.'
9358:Beasts of the night are stalking you!
9359:Use silver, or better metal, to intimidate them into backing down!
9360:Face the night beasts with spirit to gain their respect.
9361:You defeat the night beasts.{}{}
9362:The night beats defeat you and feast on your blood and life essence before you manage to escape.
9363:The night demons cower before you and skulk back into the shadows.
9364:You defeat the night beasts and they are impressed with your understanding of the mystical ways. {}{}
9365:You find an old quarry, seemingly abandoned.
9366:You find an old quarry, seemingly abandoned. As you come closer, you see traces of the past - broken equipment, abandoned tools, and discarded ore.
9367:Search the area.
9368:As you go in deeper, you discover the remains of many humanoids under a layer of thick dust. It looks as if they fought each other in a kind of frenzy that left both sides dead from blood loss and exhaustion. {}{}{}{}You then discover the tracks of something large, slithering, and heavy - and it burrowed into the rockface nearby.{}{}
9369:Gather whatever you can here and leave quickly.
9370:Go into the rockface.
9371:You search the place and find nothing of interest. It still may be possible to gather some of the stone from this place.
9372:Get the stone.
9373:You were gathering the resources in peace when you realised you now have your weapon in hand, and you feel more and more inclined to kill someone. {}{}{}{}And worse yet, you sense a powerful drain on your spirit, pulling at you mercilessly. {}{}{}{}You hear mocking laughter bellowing at you.{}{}
9374:Try to control yourself and see who is laughing.
9375:'Ssso ssstrong, you've come to pay tribute, have you?'{}{}{}{}A zmey, one of the eldest dragon kin, slithers into view from within a dark cave. 
9376:What tribute does it mean?
9377:It is a creature of mystical birth, so fight it with your spirit!
9378:You sneak in carefully and even find a few gemstones scattered around. But just as you think there is nothing more to find, you hear quiet laughter:{}{}{}{}'Ssso ssstrong, you've come to pay tribute, have you?'{}{}{}{}A zmey, one of the eldest dragon kin, slithers into view.
9379:You were gathering the resources in peace when you realised you now have your weapon in hand, and you feel more and more inclined to kill someone. {}{}{}{}You now sense there is a curse upon this place, one that may prove deadly.
9380:Resist this curse.
9381:Better just run.
9382:You shield yourself from the curse for now, but you know it will not hold for long. You sense a sudden burst of dark, tumorous energy, then you hear laughter coming from a hidden cave:{}{}{}{}'Ssso ssstrong, you've come to pay tribute, have you?'{}{}{}{}A zmey, one of the eldest dragon kin, slithers into view.{}{}
9383:'I am not asss greedy asss my drake kin. One life will sssuffice, and it doesss not need to be pure.' {}{}{}{}You think it winked at you.{}{}{}{}'I will allow you to take away their weight in treasssure.'
9384:You sacrifice one of your own, and the zmey takes them into its care with a sly smile. As it slithers away, it spits a gooey toxin in your faces. {}{}{}{}You fall into slumber, but when you wake, you feel strengthened and the promised stone lies beside you.
9385:You sacrifice one of your own, and the zmey takes them into its care with a sly smile. As it slithers away, it spits a gooey toxin in your faces. {}{}{}{}You feel sickened from the spit, and worse yet, you discover only sandstone left as your reward.
9386:The zmey shrieks in pain as you break its soul. You see a dark spirit escape, but the body lies dead before you.
9387:The zmey is fast and deadly, forcing you to drop some of your goods to squeeze through a tight spot where it cannot follow. You escape by the skin of your teeth, but not without scars. 
9388:'Sssuch sssweet sssorrow in your sssoulsss... You amusssed me. Begone, be free.'{}{}
9389:Run before it changes its mind.
9390:The zmey shrieks in pain as you strike it down. The body lies dead before you.
9391:You find an old quarry. Although the place seemed abandoned at first, you see a campfire hidden away among the rocks.
9392:Go in closer to greet the fellow travellers.
9393:[Hunter or Perception] Scout the campfire.
9394:You discover the campsite was set up by nomads, but they were attacked by bandits who are now scavenging the bodies, and they have spotted you!
9395:To arms!
9396:Stand firm, flex your muscle, and tell them to back off, now! [Intimidate]
9397:Drop some of your bags to make escape easier.
9398:You discover the campsite was set up by nomads, but they were attacked by bandits who are now scavenging the bodies.
9399:Attack the bandits!
9400:Use your wits or experience to figure out a trap for the bandits.
9401:[Bloodtracker]Sniff them out and quietly murder as many as you can.
9402:As a bloodtracker, you are skilled at hunting prey, any prey.{}{}{}{}You sneak up and silently murder several of the bandits, including the captain, and when the rest realise what is happening, they run away.
9403:As a bloodtracker, you are skilled at hunting prey, any prey.{}{}{}{}Alas, despite bathing in the blood of your enemies, there are just too many. You retreat as they chase you!
9404:Attack those who are left!
9405:You kill the bandit scum and check the camp. Alas, none of the nomads survived. {}{}{}{}You prepare a makeshift burial before leaving.
9406:You barely get away after dropping some bags to escape.
9407:'Eh, fine, fine, not worth our trouble. We're off -- you can even scavenge whatever we left here.'{}{}{}{}They carefully back away from you. 
9408:'What the fuck are you doing?' {}{}{}{}They charge!
9409:The bandits prove themselves stronger. They beat you badly, and you are forced to drop some of your goods to escape.{}{}
9410:You find an old quarry, seemingly abandoned. Most of this quarry has collapsed into a deep ravine, but there still may be some usable resources here.
9411:[Hunter or Perception]Search the area carefully.
9412:Search the quarry.
9413:Your eagle eyes come in handy when you spot, deep within the darkness of the ravine, that the earth seems to move up and down in slow rhythm. {}{}{}{}You then notice a large, dragon-like shape among the stones.
9414:[Magic user]Dragons are creatures born of the mystical force, so challenge it with your spirit and break its soul!
9415:[Magic user or zerca, and intelligence] Dragons are not mere beasts. Often they are wise and sometimes willing to talk. Approach the dragon and speak to it.
9416:Carefully back away.
9417:You carefully climb down and search the old quarry. You find little of use but see signs of ore being transported to one spot. {}{}{}{}When you get close, you see a pile of stone, some of it precious, but then you hear a rough, bellowing voice:{}{}'Who wakes me?'{}{}{}{}A red dragon is staring at you.{}{}
9418:Run for your lives!
9419:Remain calm and composed and try to speak to it.
9420:You approach the dragon and see its eyes following you with interest. You bow and speak. It listens, then replies, slowly:{}{}{}{}'Very well, a game of riddles will amuse me so. If thy mind is as sharp as my scales, you may be granted a boon.'
9421:'None of that "what's in my pants" silliness, mind you. Fool me once and all that. A serious game of riddles, nothing less will do.'
9422:Agree and promise to remain true.
9423:Actually, politely decline and move away.
9424:You barely escape as the dragon lazily breathes fire after you. You get the impression that it didn't give this chase its all.
9425:The dragon's might proves no exaggeration, and you have a feeling this one was sleepy. {}{}{}{}You do not know why, but the beast allows you to flee, albeit without your bags.
9426:'Bah, your minds are as dull as you look. How disappointing. Leave me a gift as apology, and I may reward you yet. Otherwise, begone, for you are not worthy of my notice.'{}{}{}{}You feel a great mental strain from this effort and sense it is best to leave quickly. 
9427:Offer gold.
9428:Offer a person. That should earn you a great reward.
9429:Leave quickly before it changes its mind.
9430:Your will has proven stronger than the dragon's, and it breaks before you. Distraught at the defeat, the creature flies away, leaving its lair free to loot. {}{} 
9431:Gather what you can and leave before it flies back.
9432:'Ahh, how wonderful, you did outsmart me!'{}{}{}{}It flaps its reptile wings so hard in joy that you are thrown against the rock wall.{}{}{}{}'Oh, uh. Apologies. Here is your reward, as promised, although the honour of besting a drake is your true achievement.'{}{}{}{}The dragon falls back asleep.
9433:The dragon is dead and its treasures yours. {}{} 
9434:[Perception]Scout the place first.
9435:You search through the rubble, but instead of resources, you come across a band of scavengers who don't look happy to share this site.
9436:[Scavenger]Speak to your kin. Tell them your lot is bigger and tougher, so they'd better share.
9437:You search through the rubble of this old quarry and spot traces of gold ore, but you suspect you'd have to dig deep to find anything substantial. 
9438:[Dwarf]Use your dwarven knowledge to make this dig easier.
9439:Use tools to dig.
9440:As you try to dig for gold, the earth shifts once more and almost buries you alive. {}{}{}{}You manage to scramble back up to the surface. If there was any gold, it is gone.
9441:You uncover a good stash of gold and several skeletons of miners who likely died with it.
9442:With the scavengers gone, you dig through the rubble, but apart from some basic stone, you find the quarry depleted.
9443:Apart from some stone, you find an abandoned child, locked in a cage and abused. It is grateful for your help and wants to go with you.
9444:You try to use the scavengers' superstition and a set of caves and tunnels to trick them into thinking this quarry is haunted. It works, but instead of running away, the scavengers decide to collapse the caves and kill the 'ghosts.'{}{}{}{}You barely make it out alive.
9445:You search through the rubble but instead of resources, you come across a band of scavengers. They haven't spotted you yet.
9446:Try to outsmart these scavengers before they see you.
9447:These old quarries have many caves and burrows, and scavengers are very superstitious. {}{}{}{}You goad them with suspicious sounds and falling rocks until they decide this place is haunted and abandon it, even leaving behind some of their stuff.
9448:Gather what you can.
9449:The scavengers look spooked and move away:{}{}{}{}'Ya, ya, take yer share, take, take and go.'
9450:Gather up their stuff.
9451:There are so many of them, and they look well equipped and aggressive. You think it is best to leave, now.
9452:[Hunter or Perception]Search the quarry.
9453:There seems to be a lot of good stone stacked in several big mounds -- perhaps abandoned here, or maybe the Shattering piled it here.{}{}{}{}You start loading the stone when you realise the mounds have moved. They are watching you, and you hear:{}{}{}{}'Do they look tasty to you? Bony, no?'
9454:You are fast on your feet and have good wits about you, so you manage to jump away and run to safety before the rock trolls finish what they have to say.
9455:You jump to your feet and run for your life. One of the trolls gets in a hit before you escape, but they are not fast enough to pursue.
9456:'A nature god, you say? Hmmm. Yeah, you smell of trees and stuff, earth too, I suppose. Say, if you're so friendly, give us food, and we won't eat you.'
9457:It is nature's law that the strongest prevail. Fight them!
9458:Agree to give them one of you to eat.
9459:Agree to give them food in exchange for a little stone.
9460:Demand that they leave you be or they will anger the gods of nature.
9461:You defeat the trolls, and the quarry stands open before you.
9462:Your plan failed, and the trolls look hungry.
9463:The trolls beat you and manage to grab one of you, eating that person alive in front of your very eyes as the rest of you run for your lives.
9464:'Eh, I am still not sure about those gods of yours, but best be safe than sorry. Take what stone you find -- just not my balls, eh, ha!'
9465:Smile politely and take the stone. 
9466:'You bore me with your talk. You look tasty!'
9467:There seems to be a lot of good stone stacked in several big mounds -- perhaps abandoned here, or maybe the Shattering piled it here.{}{}{}{}But you notice in time that the mounds have eyes -- rock trolls, for sure -- and they are watching you, pretending to sleep.
9468:Try to outsmart them.
9469:[Runemaster]In the name of the ancient stone masons that forged you, carve a sleeping rune onto the troll's bodies so you may take what is yours.
9470:[Nature]As trolls are creatures of nature's will, proclaim it is your domain and thus they must stand aside!
9471:While you pretend to go about gathering stone, you carve a sleeping rune onto the unsuspecting trolls and they fall into slumber. {}{}{}{}They will not lie helpless for long, so you'd best hurry.
9472:'Hmm, I did not see that coming. Nope. You live this long, and you still get surprised. Great. Here, have some stone, seems only fair.'{}{}{}{}Your fellow is taken and torn into three pieces to be devoured. Their bemused face looks at you, dead, as their head rolls down to the ground.{}{}{}{}'All that hair and teeth and gooey eyes, don't like that, you can take it back.'
9473:Gather what you got and leave.
9474:You notice that the trolls are still very sleepy. You distract them and run circles around them while others take what stone they can find. 
9475:You stand atop a small cliff, and below you see the remains of a quarry. It looks as if it's been mostly depleted, but you know these places can still hold good resources.
9476:As soon as you climb down, you see the stones below move in unnatural ways. You quickly realise they must be rockers -- young trolls. There is always danger of a parent nearby.{}{}
9477:Better not wait till they grow into trolls. Attack!
9478:[Dwarf]These wee stone babes deserve to be left in peace. In fact, leave them some food and gather the stone away from the younglings quickly before the rock mama returns.
9479:[Perception]Take a closer look around before you do anything.
9480:Approach them.
9481:You check the tracks and realise that some adults may be close by. Still, you see a lot of precious stone here and cannot easily gather it without the rockers noticing.
9482:Try to sneak around the rockers to gather as much as you can.
9483:Walk up to the rockers.
9484:The rockers see you approach and panic. They scramble around frantically, causing the whole quarry to shake dangerously. {}{}{}{}You also feel the rumblings of something bigger coming this way.
9485:Best run away.
9486:The rockers see you and get nervous at first, but as you approach without malice, they become curious. Among the shuffle of stone and grunts, you hear:{}{}'Play?'
9487:They have precious stones. Attack!
9488:Play with them.
9489:You have strong folk with you, so the play goes well. The rockers are pleased with their playmates and shower you with gifts before they usher you away, gesturing that their parents are about to return.
9490:The rockers lie shattered at your feet, and you feel this unnatural, unprovoked killing of the young did not sit well with your domain.{}{}{}{}You also hear the roaring cries of a mama troll rolling your way fast!
9491:The rockers beat you badly and force you to flee.
9492:You have strong folk with you, so the play goes well, although it proves more than just rough. The rockers are pleased with their playmates and shower you with gifts before they usher you away, gesturing that their parents are about to return.
9493:The rockers lie shattered at your feet, and you are free to gather the stone.{}{}{}{}However, you hear the roaring cries of a mama troll rolling your way fast!
9494:You give the rockers some food and quietly gather some stone on the side. {}{}{}{}The younglings seem very pleased with the gift, and your spirits are lifted.
9495:Try to gather some stone.
9496:You start digging for stone when the earth shifts and one of you gets trapped beneath the stones! 
9497:Dig them out.
9498:We have craftsmen, smart folk and tools. Figure out a safe way to dig them out.
9499:[Dwarf]Such collapses are a daily thing in the mountains, and you know ways to dig them out safely and quickly.
9500:[Orc]Such things were a daily occurrence where you lived. It is the mark of a true warrior to find their own way out!
9501:Mysteries of the earth are your daily dwarven bread, so you safely uncover your kin and manage to find some good resources while you're at it. 
9502:You dig up your friend, but they nearly died and are permanently weakened by this. 
9503:You dig them out and apart from some mental bruising they seem well. You also uncover some stone. 
9504:As it turns out, there was a warrior's soul within your friend all along and they feel stronger than ever now!{}{}{}{}You also find some stone.
9505:Alas, the unfortunate soul was not a warrior after all. They don't make it out, but you honour their brave efforts with a shield dance.{}{}{}{}You do find some stone.
9506:Hidden amid the fog and shrubbery, you discover ancient ruins before you.
9507:Among the old trees, you discover the long-abandoned remnants of an elven dwelling. 
9508:You come across the ruins of an ancient city. Most likely this was once a dwarven settlement, spat onto the surface by the Shattering.
9509:Investigate. 
9510:You discover the remains of an old settlement. 
9511:You find the remains of a nonhuman settlement deep in the forest.
9512:Take only the loot you found in the ruins, and leave the orcs be.
9513:You descend down the winding corridor until you reach a chamber with six stone columns. Between them are alcoves with granite chests and vases.{}{}
9514:As you scour some old ruins for loot, you notice you're not the first to arrive. {}{}{}{}The other group does not see you yet, but this may change at any moment.
9515:Call upon turmoil and attack whoever dares to stand in your path!
9516:As you approach the other group, you realise too late that they are not scavengers, but bandits waiting to ambush you.{}{}{}{}'We're the genero... genral? We're the kind types. We take some of your stuff, we let you leave alive.'{}{} 
9517:Agree to give them some of your stuff (to the value of 100).
9518:Try to intimidate them.
9519:Bargain with them, bandit to bandit.
9520:It looks like these are scavengers -- a rugged, scruffy lot, pillaging what they can from the ruins. {}{}{}{}You took the time to scout, so now you're in a better position for a tactical attack.
9521:[Harmony or Intellect] As your domain dictates, there must be a peaceful way out. These folks look hungry. Offer them food in exchange for letting you search the ruins as well. [Lose 20 food]
9522:Approach the scavengers and offer a deal to search the ruins together.
9523:Just leave them be.
9524:'You seem like honest types, and we are hungry. Deal. {}{}{}{}And since we ain't stupid enough to mess with your gods, you can search to the south and west of here. Be careful of the east, though -- the air seems foul there, and two of ours never came back to say what's hiding there.'{}{}
9525:Check the west side.
9526:Check the south side.
9527:Ignore the warning and explore the east side.
9528:You enter the eastern part of the ruins and find that a deep, nasty gash has been torn in the ground beneath you. {}{}{}{}From within, you sense a presence, watching, waiting...{}{}{}{}You feel a warm glow that seems pleasant at first, then becomes stifling, hot, and burning!
9529:Stay and fight this thing!
9530:'I suppose if you give us some food, we can let you search this place. {}{}{}{}Or we could trade with what we found so far.' 
9531:Give them some food so you can search. [Lose 20 food]
9532:Attack them instead.
9533:Actually, just leave.
9534:'We go now. You don't kill us!'{}{}{}{}The scavengers look at you and decide the loot is not worth their lives. They run away.{}{}
9535:'You scary, but you not many. We take you!'
9536:You scout ahead and discover that it is a group of bandits pretending to scavenge the ruins, but in fact waiting to ambush you!
9537:Attack them with a preemptive strike!
9538:'You think you scary, eh? Think again, scum!'{}{}{}{}While you were talking, they were getting ready to fight, and they launch at you.
9539:Throw them some of your stuff and run away!
9540:You kill the bandits and take their spoils!{}{}{}{}But the ruins were clearly looted many times over already.
9541:The burning light is overwhelming. It burns your very soul, threatening to dissolve it entirely and bind it to the ever-glowing presence. {}{}{}{}Just as you think you?ll succumb, the light retreats, perhaps still too weak to fully take you.
9542:Your spirit is strong and pushes away the burning light that threatened to devour your very soul.{}{}{}{}At least now you can loot the ruins in peace, although you remain shaken by the experience. 
9543:Search the ruins and leave.
9544:'Nah, we don't wanna deal with your sort. Beat it!'
9545:Your decisive attack destroys the enemy, but you did not notice a small group taking off with what they looted here.{}{}{}{}Still, you are now free to continue searching the ruins. {}{}
9546:Check the east side. 
9547:You skilfully dispatch the enemy. {}{}{}{}You are now free to continue searching the ruins. {}{}
9548:Defeated, you run for your lives, having to leave behind some of your supplies. 
9549:'I guess dealin's more profitable-like, sure. We can trade, or you can bugger off. Call it professional cort... curtsy?'
9550:'Eh, you look burly enough, and we're gettin' tired. Perhaps it's best we give you some of our stuff and you leave us be, eh?'
9551:Agree to take their stuff and let them be.
9552:Attack them instead. The fight should be easier now that they're scared!
9553:You are sorely beaten and perhaps drop some of your stuff so they won't chase you.{}{}{}{}'Lucky we ain't evil, else we'd take all your things!'
9554:You feel strengthened by your god.{}{}
9555:Among the mostly looted ruins, you discover an untouched chamber hidden beneath a load of rubble that must have shifted recently.
9556:Perform a ritual to ease this demon's disturbed soul. 
9557:You calm the mrucek so well that its body visibly changes, and it now resembles a common cat, only fluffier and fat. {}{}{}{}It purrs and disappears through the entrance you made.{}{}{}{}You feel a blessing upon you.{}{}
9558:The mrucek purrs even louder and then pounces on you, claws and teeth first. {}{}{}{}You shake it off and it scampers away, leaving you with a few deep cuts and a curse.{}{}
9559:The mrucek purrs even louder and then pounces on you, claws and teeth first. {}{}{}{}You shake it off and it scampers away, leaving you with a few deep cuts and a curse.
9560:This room looks like it could have been an old armoury, and although it was clearly evacuated, there may be some usable leftovers to find. 
9561:Search the room and gather anything still useful.
9562:In the darkest corner of the chamber lurks a creature, its beady eyes flickering in darkness. {}{}{}{}It is clearly watching you. 
9563:[Strigas] You sense a striga presence. Try to dominate whatever lurks in the shadows.
9564:You sense a creature of the night. In the name of Horz, lord of the moon, call the creature to heel.
9565:Attack with a preemptive strike. 
9566:Keep watching the creature and loot the place, hoping it will not attack.
9567:A starved striga bows before your dominance, then offers up the last of its life force for you to devour. 
9568:Devour the striga. Then gather up whatever loot you can find here. 
9569:Leave the creature be. Gather up whatever loot is left and go.
9570:A starved striga bows before your dominance, then scampers off through the opening you made. 
9571:Gather up whatever loot is left and go.
9572:A starved striga lashes out at you, forcing you to abandon the room and run. {}{}{}{}The wounds it left turn out to be infected.{}{}
9573:You kill the striga and are free to loot the place.
9574:The starved striga lashes out at you, forcing you to abandon the room and run. {}{}{}{}The wounds it left turn out to be infected.{}{}
9575:The dark mist destroyed most of what once stood here, but you find a fairly fresh corpse to loot. 
9576:As you look up at the trees, you see the remains of an old elven dwelling with fallen rope bridges and abandoned structures that have almost entirely become part of the trees again. {}{}{}{}Who knows what secrets it may hold? 
9577:Go up to explore the ruins.
9578:You find many abandoned structures, but they are either empty or impossible to reach. You see one that seems more intact, but the winding stairway is almost entirely collapsed and the tree bark sharp as nails, so it will be a difficult climb.
9579:[Wood folk]This is not an obstacle for you. Whisper to the trees so that you may climb up unharmed. 
9580:[Nature] Call upon your domain,  to ask the forest for help in this climb.
9581:Climb up carefully.
9582:The forest listens and allows you to climb without issue.
9583:Search the place with care. 
9584:The forest proves merciful, and you climb without a hitch. {}{}{}{}You stand in a deceptively large, open chamber, its walls made of strange crystal now overgrown with vines and flowers, with remnants of old furniture and art-- fragile and forgotten, yet still beautiful.
9585:The climb proves too difficult. The remains of the staircase fall apart, and you see no other way to climb here. 
9586:You climb up and find a series of abandoned tree houses, most now inaccessible and overgrown.{}{}{}{}You find some scattered herbs and pieces of usable wood, but little more.{}{}{}{}But you do hear a strange, disturbing, mumbling sound nearby.
9587:Gather what you already have and leave.
9588:After searching awhile, you discover a hidden trap door that leads inside a tree trunk. {}{}{}{}Within, you see what once could have been a workshop but is now a hollow, dark room, overgrown with greenery and cobwebs.{}{}{}{}Among it all, you see a lone elf, rocking and mumbling to themselves.
9589:[Elf]Speak to them softly in your tongue. Try to calm them.
9590:Try talking to them.
9591:Put them out of their misery.
9592:[Forest demon]Use the tongue of the forest to soothe this creature's troubled soul.
9593:[Orc]Kill it.
9594:You walk through the chamber and discover many hidden alcoves, corridors leading to long-destroyed paths, and a small back room. {}{}{}{}Within, you see the remains of tools, vials, herbs, and perhaps even books.{}{}{}{}There's also a nest of crows eagerly watching your every move.
9595:Intimidate the crows.
9596:With the crows gone, you can search the room in peace.
9597:The elf stops for a second, turns his head towards you, listens, and then recoils again, mumbling:{}{}{}{}'Light, too much, too much, failed again, failed... burning...'{}{}{}{}The elf is clearly ancient, perhaps from the days of the darkness, judging by the faded scars of the dark curse, but his mind is so very lost. 
9598:Offer some of your spirit health to ease his mind and perhaps get him to talk to you.
9599:Slap him in the face. It sometimes helps with crazy.
9600:'Light, too much, too much, failed again, failed... burning...'{}{}{}{}The elf does not seem to acknowledge your presence.
9601:Kill the elf. 
9602:Just loot the room and leave this strange elf be.
9603:[Orc]Kill it quickly before the crazy rubs off on you.
9604:You kill the elf with one precise blow, his weakened body offering no resistance.{}{}{}{}But as the flesh dissolves into dust, it does so with a violent burst of blinding light that scorches both your body and soul!{}{}
9605:Gather up any loot you find and leave.
9606:You kill the elf with one precise blow, his weakened body offering no resistance.{}{}{}{}The body turns to silver dust and you feel your soul strengthened by this act of mercy, whether intended or accidental. 
9607:'I... thank thee, kindred spirits, for even this fleeting moment of clarity sings to my soul in the most sublime fancy...'{}{}{}{}He hums a sad, striking melody.{}{}{}{}Then suddenly he twists in pain, eyes glowing with a faint light, rocking again as he screams at you:{}{}{}{}'End this, end this sorrow now, I beg of thee!'
9608:Call upon nature and ask this forest to allow their child the ever-sleep, for in time it may cure his sickened mind.
9609:His mind is clearly assaulted by some mystical force. It is too strong to destroy, but you can connect with the elf spiritually and try to shield him.
9610:It is not the way of harmony to destroy life, even life that is tormented like this. Call upon your domain to try to shield the poor creature from whatever ails it. 
9611:The elf may yet recover. It is not your business, so leave him be. Gather up whatever you found so far and depart.
9612:The forest listens. Vines and roots from the tree engulf the elf in a protective shell.{}{}{}{}His body slowly relaxes, his skin turning more silver until it looks like a serene, perfectly carved statue of a sleeping divine. {}{}{}{}You see a bundle clad in oak leaves. You know this is your reward, be it from the forest or the elf. {}{}
9613:Take the gift and leave.
9614:The forest listens. Vines and roots from the tree engulf the elf in a protective shell. {}{}{}{}His body slowly relaxes, his skin turning more silver until it looks like a serene, perfectly carved statue of a sleeping divine. {}{}{}{}You see a bundle clad in oak leaves. You know this is your reward, be it from the forest or the elf. 
9615:Your ritual works. You shield the elf's mind from whatever twisted force is assailing him. {}{}{}{}You do not know how long it will last, or if he even knows what has happened, but his body seems more relaxed and still. {}{}{}{}You see a bundle clad in oak leaves. You know this is your reward, be it from the forest or the elf. 
9616:Whatever holds this elf's mind and soul is too strong for you.{}{}{}{}The tormented forest kin recoils from you and rocks again, mumbling indistinguishably.
9617:The elf looks at you, bewildered:{}{}{}{}'Creature of the dark, turmoil? Chaos? Violence all it speaks, violence... perhaps the light is good, yes, perhaps, perhaps it is time to embrace it...' {}{}{}{}He starts to glow. 
9618:'So brutal, your kindred, so... simple... Yet a moment's respite... fleeting so...'{}{}{}{}Then suddenly he twists in pain, eyes glowing with a faint light, rocking again as he screams at you:{}{}{}{}'End this, end this sorrow now, I beg of thee!'
9619:You climb up to explore the elven ruins but hear an unsettling stirring in the forest. Some of the trees seem to be descending upon you!
9620:[Leshy]Call upon the forest to heed your will!
9621:[Wood folk]Speak to the forest and proclaim your elven right to be here.
9622:[Nature]Affirm your allegiance to the woodland and ask the forest to calm itself.
9623:Try to negotiate with the clearly angry forest.
9624:[Forest demons]Your kin look very angry. Offer them your spirit health as tribute in exchange for free passage.
9625:You give your spirit essence and the forest calms, for now.{}{}{}{}You're free to search the ruins now.
9626:Finish the exploration quickly and leave.
9627:The forest heeds your words and calms its anger, allowing you entry without further resistance.
9628:Finish the exploration and leave.
9629:'Yoou smeelll of woodkin, yoou maay passs.'
9630:The forest does not listen or respond. Its anger is old and raw!{}{}
9631:Although most of the old city is unsalvageable, you find what could be an old stockroom or maybe a weaponsmith's workshop where you find some good resources still intact.
9632:The forest guardians lie dead, so you are free to loot the ruins in peace. 
9633:Continue searching the ruins.
9634:Although most of the old city is unsalvageable, you discover what could have been a craftsman's studio. 
9635:While searching the remains of a goblin settlement, you realise that a pack of wild boars occupies one of the largest remaining huts.
9636:[Turmoil or strength] Honour the turmoil of your souls and attack these boars with your bare fists!
9637:[Hunter or Nature] Hunting is a thing of nature for you. Do it.
9638:[Boar rider or beastmaster] Boars are a goblin thing. Get them in line. 
9639:You stalk the boars and wait for the perfect chance to pick off the weakest ones first, then strike down the rest. 
9640:Attack the weakened pack.
9641:Intimidate the rest of the pack.
9642:Actually, better leave the boars alone. 
9643:You manage to wrestle one of the boars to the ground and strangle it!{}{}{}{}The others run away at your display of raw power. You feel your spirits lifted by this deed.{}{}
9644:Search the place and leave.
9645:The hut proved to be the remains of a shaman's lair, but much of it has been destroyed by the boars.{}{}{}{}You find a rack of dried herbs and packs of supplies, suggesting the hut was in use recently.{}{}
9646:[Goblin shaman]Search for the lore book.
9647:[Magic or magic user] Try to connect to the lingering weaves of magic here.
9648:You know well the hidey-holes of your tribesmen. You quickly find a leather-bound book filled with mystical knowledge.
9649:Your connection to the weaves of magic allows you to soak up the energies gathered here safely. {}{}{}{}You feel your spirit strengthened.{}{}
9650:You get on all fours, then squeal and grunt and rummage the dirt threateningly. {}{}{}{}The boars shuffle and leave, bowing their tusks to you. The animals also reveal a few dead bodies for you to loot. 
9651:The boars are dead, and you are free to search the hut.
9652:You spook the boars and they run off into the woods. 
9653:You manage to wrestle one of the boars to the ground and strangle it! One of the others stays and decides to follow you.{}{}{}{}You feel your spirits lifted by this deed.{}{}
9654:You get on all fours, then squeal and grunt and rummage the dirt threateningly. {}{}{}{}The boars shuffle and grunt back, becoming even more agitated!{}{}
9655:The boars charge angrily, and you have to drop some food to avoid being trampled!{}{}
9656:[Light] Call upon light and Svarog to give praise to this sacred place. 
9657:'Ah, the young human smith and his kin -- a good pupil he was, good promise for one not made of stone and metal.{}{}{}{}Come, join me at my work. We shall give honour to the metal, and I guess your gods too. Why not?'
9658:'Well, ya tried, that you did. Good on ya. Stone and metal be with ya, lassies.'{}{}
9659:'Ah, your 'gods', aye, that light of yours seems like an honourable sort of path. {}{}{}{}We ain't that fussed about kickin' your butts, so you can wait till we're done, then take what is left.'
9660:These dwarven ruins look older and darker than usual. There is an air of reverence here that is hard to explain.{}{}{}{}The stone remains look abandoned and forlorn, but you spot a firelight in the distance.
9661:Go forth, carefully.
9662:As you get closer, you realise that the fire comes from several torches held by a small group of heavily armed dwarves battling a pack of unliving.{}{}{}{}The dwarves stand firm, using fire to help them, but the unliving are beginning to swarm them. 
9663:Perform a ritual to try to weaken these unliving fiends. 
9664:[Dwarf]Aid your brethren, quick!
9665:Help the dwarves!
9666:[Nature or intellect]Stand aside and let them fight their own battles. 
9667:Wait to see who wins, then get rid of them.
9668:[Unliving]Help your kin!
9669:It is not your place to interfere in the conflict of others. You feel your domain strengthened by this resolve.{}{}{}{}You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are overwhelmed by the unliving, and now you can face the remaining threat that is running your way.{}{}
9670:[Unliving]Try to reason with your kin.
9671:The dwarves stop and look at your medic:{}{}{}{}'So first ya stood there watchin' us bleed, and now ya wanna help. Fleshies... Fine, help, we didn't need your puny help to fight.'
9672:Tend to their wounds.
9673:While the dwarves are off guard, attack them!
9674:'So ya stood there like a bunch of lassies rubbing stones! Bah. Well, ya can be of use now helping us secure these ruins from the unliving filth. This is our heritage and we were charged with guarding it. We'll give ya some of the stuff the filth dropped in payment.'
9675:Tell them it is even less dwarven to whine about having to do your own fighting. Say you will help them work for a fee. 
9676:'Fine, ya can also salvage these ruins, with care!'
9677:'Just bugger off, ya weaselly gits! Now!'
9678:'Ya know, many in this world would see our weakness and finish us off. Maybe ya ain't that bad after all.{}{}{}{}Take the shit the undead left, if ya like.{}{}{}{}Here, have this as well, as thanks. Now be off! We have guarding duty to go back to.'
9679:You are victorious, and the plunder is yours for the taking!
9680:'Ya may be cowards, but what's it to us?{}{}{}{}We're wounded, and we have a job to do. If ya help us secure this place, we'll give ya the loot from the unliving filth, deal?'
9681:Agree and help.
9682:Your words fall on deaf ears and you are chased away from the ruins. 
9683:'Ha! That was some good fightin'. {}{}{}{}Not that we needed the help, but we thank ya nonetheless. Say, have the loot from all these dead buggers, as thanks.' 
9684:Say it was no problem, and ask what they are doing here.
9685:Ask for payment for your good deed.
9686:'We were sent here to clear an unliving nest. Those filthy buggers been shitting on our heritage! {}{}{}{}We only have one tunnel to block now. {}{}{}{}Tell ya what, if you help out, we'll give you a bit extra.'
9687:Agree to help. 
9688:You are defeated and forced to run away!
9689:It is not your place to interfere in the conflict of others. You feel your domain strengthened by this resolve.{}{}{}{}You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are victorious and now are running angrily your way.{}{}
9690:Attack the dwarves.
9691:Try to reason with them.
9692:[Dwarf]Congratulate your brethren on a fight well fought.
9693:You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are overwhelmed by the unliving, and now you can face the remaining threat that is running your way.
9694:You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are victorious and now are running angrily your way.
9695:Offer medical help and say that it would not have been honourable to interfere.
9696:The unliving recognise your kinship and help and wander off. You're free to loot the dwarves and the ruins.
9697:The dwarf spits. {}{}{}{}'Ya have what we're willin to give, so bugger off.'
9698:'Bah, this world is wretchedly cold. {}{}{}{}Here, have this as payment for your kindness. Metal and stone be with ya.'
9699:You find the scattered remains of an old orcish settlement. In the old days, the clans were mostly nomadic, so this is a rare find. {}{}{}{}As you search the crude yet sturdy old structures, you spot a group of orcs also arriving here.
9700:Shout to them that like the daughters of Zorya that rule their own clans, you too follow the warrior goddess and thus have the right to these spoils!
9701:In the name of harmony, try to talk to them.
9702:'Surender!'{}{}{}{}The orcs spit, turn away from you, and wait for you to leave in shame.
9703:These elven ruins look fairly fresh, seemingly abandoned due to violence rather than age. The elves were evacuated, but you may still find some usable resources. 
9704:You find a chest with some weaponry, but just as you reach for it, an unstable building above you crumbles on you, leaving many bruises.{}{}{}{}Still, you get the chest.
9705:Take the chest.
9706:You realise that these are no ruins, but the burial ground of an orc clan.{}{}{}{}You see several old pyres and one new. You also spot a pack of wolves circling.
9707:The wolves are beaten and submit to your charge. This pack will continue to roam, but you will be able to call on its aid. {}{}{}{}
9708:The goblin ruins are mostly empty, but you discover a hollowed-out tree with a stash inside.
9709:The ruins are old and decrepit, likely already looted many times over, but you never know what hidden secrets you may yet uncover.{}{}{}{}The south area seems less traversed, but also unstable. 
9710:Investigate the south.
9711:Investigate the safer areas.
9712:You find a hidden cellar -- or, rather, it finds you as you painfully fall through its ceiling onto a hard floor. Still, there is loot to be found here.{}{}{}{}
9713:Gather it.
9714:Much of these elven ruins have collapsed from their treetop spaces and now lie in pieces beneath your feet. {}{}{}{}Still, they may hold some hidden treasures. From the largest cluster of debris, you hear a loud, thudding buzz. Most likely, there's a beehive here.
9715:[Wood folk or Nature] Walk in calmly, with respect and kindness towards the law of nature. 
9716:[Hunter or perception] Scout the area before moving forwards.
9717:Try to observe the area before you move in.
9718:The bees have nested in a large piece of a fallen elven structure. Their presence has likely scared off other looters. {}{}{}{}Some bees have spotted your approach but so far do not attack.
9719:Continue to search the ruins. Remain mindful of the bees. 
9720:Try to sneak past the bees to loot the place.
9721:The bees have nested in a large piece of a fallen elven structure. Their presence has likely scared off other looters. {}{}{}{}You also notice they are currently very focused on one particular spot.
9722:[Hunters]Try to sneak past the bees to loot the place.
9723:The bees have nested in a large piece of a fallen elven structure. Their presence has likely scared off other looters. {}{}{}{}Alas, you did not notice quickly enough that a swarm is flying your way!
9724:The bees surround you but do not attack. You are free to search the fallen building, and even better, the bees offer you some of their sweet honey as well. 
9725:Great. Gather what you find and leave. 
9726:You sneak past the bees and are free to loot in this safer area. 
9727:You destroy the whole hive and discover a wonderful stash of fresh honey. You are also free to loot the fallen building now. 
9728:Eat the honey and loot the place.
9729:The rush of sweet honey makes you ill, but hey, it was worth it!
9730:These bees sure knew how to make honey. You feel strengthened from the sweet nectar.{}{}
9731:These bees sure knew how to make honey. You feel strengthened from the sweet nectar.
9732:Great. Thank the bees, gather the loot, and leave. 
9733:The bees surround you and most of them stay calm, but a few get agitated and sting you. {}{}{}{}Still, you are free to search the fallen building, and even better, the bees offer you some of their sweet honey as well. 
9734:How rude. Attack them!
9735:You are noticed. The angry bees swarm you and force you to flee.
9736:The ruins you are about to search have an unsettling stench of decay about them. 
9737:Scout the area first.
9738:Focus on your domain to see clearly.
9739:Search the ruins carefully.
9740:You observe the quiet remains of a once-great city and soon realise that among the fog walk the unliving!
9741:Sneak past them to loot the ruins.
9742:Perform a ritual to grant you protection from these fiends.
9743:Devise a tactical plan to defeat them.
9744:The unliving lie, er, deader, and you're free to loot the ruins in peace. 
9745:The unliving overwhelm you. You are forced to flee.
9746:Amidst the mist and fallen homes, you are ambushed by the unliving!
9747:Your plan worked. The unliving do not notice you.{}{}
9748:The unliving overwhelm you despite all your plans. You are forced to flee.
9749:Your words come just in time. The unliving stop in their tracks, look at you for a moment, then nod and walk off aimlessly. 
9750:Through the weaves of magic or the currents of nature's energy, you sense the presence of the unliving here!
9751:The unliving stop and do not attack, but neither do they let you search the ruins.
9752:Use this moment of distraction to attack them!
9753:The site holds the scattered remains of a settlement. Among the rubble, you find a pack of small winged critters with big eyes and tiny teeth. They are burrowing in the rubble.
9754:Catch them. 
9755:[Skshack]Greet the hochlicks and tell them they'd better not think they can fool you!
9756:Examine these creatures carefully before acting.
9757:Talk to the creatures. 
9758:You kill the creatures without much effort. 
9759:Examine the bodies. 
9760:Search the bodies.
9761:You kill some of the creatures, but a few fly up and shout at you:{}{}{}{}'Your teeth will rot and your farts burn, nasty bigfolk!'
9762:Shake your fists at them, then continue searching the ruins.
9763:Examine the bodies to figure out what they are. 
9764:You examine the bodies of the critters you killed, and you think they are hochlicks, mischievous little things. It is best to leave their bodies untouched and stay on guard for any more payback.
9765:Continue searching the ruins anyway.
9766:Perhaps it is best to just leave.
9767:As you make your way out of the ruins, you hear a menacing, vibrating buzz behind you.{}{}{}{}You do not stop to see what fate you averted. 
9768:From the bodies you can tell they were hochlicks, mischievous little things. It is best to leave their bodies untouched. 
9769:Leave them be and search the ruins in peace.
9770:You think these are hochlicks, mischievous little things prone to leading folk astray in swamps or forests.
9771:Speak to them, but keep your guard up.
9772:Try to bribe them with tasty food.
9773:Offer them gold, or better, in exchange for a favour. This should bind them into a demon deal.
9774:You search the bodies and a gooey, bluish ooze explodes on your faces.{}{}{}{}You feel really sick from it. 
9775:Have the healers quickly look you over.
9776:As you rummage through the ruins, your luck fails at every step. Floors and walls collapse, rotten wood breaks in your hands, and treasures turn out to be rusty and useless. {}{}{}{}After many hours of such pointless work, you give up. 
9777:As you search through the rubble of fallen buildings, you spot the winged critters again. They smirk and stick their tongues out at you.{}{}{}{}You are about to chase them away when you realise that they brought friends. {}{}{}{}A swarm of angry bees overwhelms you, forcing you to flee!
9778:As you rummage through the ruins, your luck fails at every step. Floors and walls collapse, rotten wood breaks in your hands, and treasures turn out to be rusty and useless. {}{}{}{}Eventually, you gather some resources, but you feel exhausted, and you can swear you hear the laughter of little critters. 
9779:The sickness lingers, and to make things worse, the ruins yield no goods. 
9780:The sickness lingers, and the ruins yield few usable goods. 
9781:Your medics stopped the sickness, leaving you free to explore the ruins. 
9782:You capture the critters and they squeak at you:{}{}{}{}'Nooo, let us gooo, let us gooo, big fella! We will show you treasures, yes?'
9783:Agree to the deal.
9784:Examine the creatures carefully.
9785:The critters lead you to a hatch hidden deep in the shrubbery.{}{}{}{}As you open it eagerly, a swarm of angry bees flies out, stinging you like crazy!{}{}{}{}You hear the hochlicks laugh. But you do find some resources. {}{}
9786:The hochlicks lead you to a chest of decent resources. 
9787:'Ah, you know your stuff, chubby. A deal's a deal. We will show ya a good spot for treasure, with just the minimum chance of slight trouble. Best we can do for ya!'
9788:Perhaps it is best to just leave, even though you've lost the treasure.
9789:'Oh, hi. We're just relaxing here. You know, we got all this treasure, too little to carry it all, so just staying chill for now...'
9790:Pretend you are not interested at all. Ignore them. 
9791:Ask them to show you this treasure. 
9792:'Oh, come, come, don't be so mean. We promise to behave. {}{}{}{}It's an honest coin toss. We'll lead you to treasure, but there'll be a chance for some good old mischief. Can't get a more honest offer than this, no sir!'
9793:'Yes, yes, come, come.'{}{}
9794:Follow the creatures.
9795:Perhaps it is best to just leave, even though you've lost the food.
9796:'Ah, our furry stinker friend, no fooling you, no. {}{}{}{}Honest to gods, we can show ya treasure. Go there, go, go, we wait for stupid big folk to come here, so take the stuff and beat it, friends!'
9797:Thank them and go collect the goods.
9798:As you come closer to inspect the ruins, you discover a goblin encampment outside the remains of the only stone building in this place.{}{}{}{}Some folk camped there are asleep, but a shaman is dancing around the bonfire, making strange noises. 
9799:[Orc]Go kill those little green gits!
9800:[Goblin]Say hello. 
9801:Go speak to them.
9802:You kill the goblins, but when you search the ruins you discover they are eerily empty. {}{}{}{}The only loot you find is from the destroyed campsite. 
9803:Gather what you find and leave.
9804:A guard stops you, but it is the shaman who slows his dance and speaks to you across the camp:{}{}{}{}'What you want here? We are private folk. This is our land. Leave.'
9805:[Spirits]Tell them you were merely curious about these ancient ruins and their presence here.
9806:Convince them you are not here to disturb them, but you'd like to explore the ruins. 
9807:Say that you are skilled in magic and offer to help with whatever ritual they are undertaking.
9808:The shaman slows his dance and speaks to you across the camp:{}{}{}{}'This place was once a great goblin city. Before the dark, even. Many gonefathers walked this soil. I am honouring their spirit passing. {}{}{}{}Will you join me?{}{}{}{}The ritual be dangerous, but as shaman you do not risk much.?
9809:Agree to join.
9810:Change your mind and leave.
9811:'Ah, a spirit, me sorry, very sorry for the rude words, old one. {}{}{}{}We are here seeking the gonefathers' blessings. This was once a great goblin city and the veil to the greyworld -- your domain -- is thin here.{}{}{}{}Would you like to join? I warn you it isn't always safe. Our gonefathers may be confused -- violent, even.'
9812:'Stop your talk, we busy. Leave, please.'
9813:You smoke some odd weeds and ingest many shrooms. Then you think you are dancing with the stars.{}{}{}{}You feel a strong mental malady afterwards, yet your spirit was strengthened as well. {}{}{}{}The goblins are gone when you awaken from the dance.{}{}
9814:You smoke some odd weeds and ingest many shrooms. Then you think you are dancing with the stars.{}{}{}{}You feel a strong spiritual malady, as the gonefathers clearly did not approve. {}{}{}{}The goblins are gone when you awaken from the dance.{}{}
9815:'Sure, you go see ruins, just keep quiet.'
9816:Explore the ruins. 
9817:'Hmm, we do not like strangers meddling. But this job big, you smell of magic. I agree.'
9818:Join the ritual.
9819:'Well done, friends, the gonefathers have spoken to us, and it seems they deemed you worthy of their wisdom. Here, have this in gratitude.{}{}{}{}Now we must move on. Lady Luck be with you.'{}{}
9820:'Ayayay, best leave, best leave quick, friends, spirits no happy!'{}{}
9821:The shaman dance begins slowly and quietly. Strange weeds are smoked, shrooms are ingested, and soon, the two shamans are entranced in a wild spiritual ecstasy. {}{}{}{}The ritual is draining, but the gonefathers dance with you well.{}{}{}{}
9822:The shaman dance begins slowly and quietly. Strange weeds are smoked, shrooms are ingested, and soon, the two shamans are entranced in a wild spiritual ecstasy. {}{}{}{}Even though the gonefathers remained silent, you have learned much. The shaman thanks you for your help and leaves you a gift. 
9823:The shaman dance begins slowly and quietly. Strange weeds are smoked, shrooms are ingested, and soon, the two shamans are entranced in a wild spiritual ecstasy. {}{}{}{}The gonefathers danced with you well.{}{}
9824:A guard stops you with a smile:{}{}{}{}'Ah, a fellow spiritchild, welcome. What brings you here?'{}{}
9825:Ask about the ritual of the gonefathers you see the shaman performing.
9826:Say that you were merely exploring these ruins.
9827:'Ah, I see. {}{}{}{}We are here seeking the gonefathers' blessings. This was once a great goblin city, and the veil to the greyworld -- the spirit domain -- is thin here.{}{}{}{}Would you like to join us? I warn you it isn't always safe. Our gonefathers may be confused -- violent, even.'
9828:'Ah, I see. {}{}{}{}We are here seeking the gonefathers' blessings. This was once the site of a great city, and the veil to the greyworld -- the spirit domain -- is thin here.{}{}{}{}You are a stranger, yet come with kin. We will allow it.'
9829:The goblins beat you badly and you feel that the shaman has cursed you too!{}{}
9830:When you search the ruins, you discover they are eerily empty. The goblins have made fools of you!{}{}{}{}But when you rush back to the encampment, it is gone as if it were never there. You find a pack of fresh supplies that was left for you, with a note:{}{}{}{}'Sorry, you were so convincing. We couldn't say no...'{}{}
9831:Take the supplies and leave.
9832:A fresh, deep chasm in the earth reveals the underground ruins of a dwarven town. {}{}{}{}The climb down is steep and the landing hard, but the ruins may hold many wonders.
9833:[Dwarves]Climbing walls is no problem. Climb down.
9834:Either you are well versed in rock climbing, or you have wings. Climb down. 
9835:[Tools] Use your crafting tools to climb down.
9836:Climb down.
9837:You locate a path to climb down easily and find yourself in an old town square. {}{}{}{}There are fallen statues of dwarven heroes and grand buildings, all crumbled and broken.{}{}{}{}You feel a small tremor and know that a big one may follow soon. {}{}{}{}There are three places left intact to explore, and from the dwarven markings, you know what they are.
9838:Explore the workshop.
9839:Search the storage building.
9840:Risk going in deeper to check the vaults.
9841:You locate a path to climb down easily and find yourself in an old town square. {}{}{}{}There are fallen statues of dwarven heroes and grand buildings, all crumbled and broken. You feel a small tremor and know that a big one may follow soon. {}{}{}{}There are three places left intact to explore.
9842:Search the first, closest place.
9843:Go to the second building.
9844:Explore the building farthest away. 
9845:You find a small yet spacious building that was some kind of stonemason's workshop. {}{}{}{}Most of the valuables have been taken already, but you still find some good stone here.
9846:Take the loot and leave for the surface. 
9847:Take the loot and try searching the storage building.
9848:Take what you found and try to loot the vault as well.
9849:This building was once some kind of hunter's lodge or perhaps a trophy room. {}{}{}{}It holds leathers and bones from many different creatures.{}{}
9850:Take the loot and try searching the workshop.
9851:You find the grand entrance to the vaults. The gates are solid stone and metal, with runes carved deep into the surface to ward against intruders.
9852:[Runemaster]Disable the runes. 
9853:The domain of light guides your path as well as the path of any great smith, even a runesmith. Pray for divine intervention to disable the runes.
9854:These dwarven runes are heavy with ancient magic. Attempt to break them.
9855:Try to force the vault open!
9856:You find a small yet spacious building that was some kind of stonemason's workshop. {}{}{}{}Most of the valuables have been taken already, but you still find some good stone here.{}{}{}{}Before you can take a better look elsewhere, a tremor starts, and you are forced to run for it.
9857:Run back to the surface.
9858:This building was once some kind of hunter's lodge or perhaps a trophy room. {}{}{}{}It holds leathers and bones from many different creatures.{}{}{}{}Before you can take a better look elsewhere, a tremor starts, and you are forced to run for it.{}{}
9859:You find the grand entrance to the vaults. The gates are solid stone and metal, with runes carved deep into the surface to ward against intruders.{}{}{}{}You see the skeleton of an adventurer who tried their luck at getting in. You grab its pack.{}{}{}{}Before you can take a better look elsewhere, a tremor starts, and you are forced to run for it.{}{}
9860:You break the runes, and the vault stands open for the taking.{}{}{}{}Within is a chamber that was once surely grand and ornate, but now most of it is collapsed and lies covered in rubble.{}{}{}{}Still there are chests and vases that hold many treasures. {}{}
9861:You find the grand entrance to the vaults. The gates are solid stone and metal, with runes carved deep into the surface to ward against intruders.{}{}{}{}Unfortunately, you venture deep into the ruins, and the tremors catch you fast and strong. {}{}{}{}You get hit by falling debris as you run for your lives.{}{}
9862:The climb seems impossible. You fall onto a ledge, which saves your life, but before you can try again, another violent tremor collapses whatever lies beneath you, and you barely manage to climb back up in time to survive. 
9863:You hit the vault gates with all you've got and the stone crumbles before you... only to reveal another, thicker layer, mocking your efforts with its pristine strength.{}{}{}{}You can, however, gather up some stone here before the tremors become too violent for you to stick around.
9864:The runes are old and powerful. Not only do your attempts fail, but you also feel the runes push back. {}{}{}{}And then the earth begins to shake again, and you must run if you hope to leave this place.
9865:'QWERTY' sounds a low, stone-like voice in response to your command, and the runes switch off.{}{}{}{}Within is a chamber that was once surely grand and ornate, but now most of it is collapsed and lies covered in rubble.{}{}{}{}Still there are chests and vases that hold many treasures. {}{}
9866:This building was once some kind of hunter's lodge or perhaps a trophy room. {}{}{}{}It holds leathers and bones from many different creatures.{}{}{}{}Before you can take a better look elsewhere, the tremor starts, and you are forced to run for it.{}{}
9867:You find a small yet spacious building that was some kind of stonemason's workshop. {}{}{}{}Most of the valuables have been taken already, but you still find some good stone here.{}{}{}{}You manage to loot some of it before tremors kick in and everything starts collapsing.
9868:You find the broken grand entrance to the vaults. The gates were solid stone and metal, with runes carved deep into the surface to ward against intruders.{}{}{}{}The ground shakes heavily here, and you grab a few shiny stones as you run out, hoping not to get crushed by the violent tremors that destroyed this place. 
9869:Whatever chamber lay here before now lies in ruins. Violent tremors tear the ground apart before your eyes. 
9870:You locate a path to climb down easily and find yourself in an old town square. {}{}{}{}There are fallen statues of dwarven heroes and grand buildings, all crumbled and broken.{}{}{}{}You feel a small tremor and know that a big one may follow soon. {}{}{}{}There are three places left intact to explore.
9871:You find signs of an old dwarven settlement, much of it likely still underground, but you discover an entrance protected by a huge slab of stone. {}{}{}{}As you try to move the stone, you hear:{}{}{}{}'Oi, what'ya want?'{}{}{}{}The stone turns to face you.
9872:[Dwarf]You know how to deal with rock trolls. Attack it. 
9873:[Dwarf]Tell the rock troll you have the right to go in.
9874:[Harmony]Draw inspiration from your peaceful domain. Apologise to the rock troll for the intrusion.
9875:Apologise to the rock troll for the intrusion.
9876:It's a rock troll -- run!
9877:It's a rock troll - run!
9878:You scream, the rock troll screams back, you each run in different directions, and the commotion makes all the stones fall over!
9879:You kill the troll, but alas, in death it collapses the tunnel to the ruins entirely!{}{}{}{}Still, you gather some minerals from the entrance itself, and you even find a small diamond deposit.  
9880:The troll beats you badly, and for a moment, you think it will eat you, but it settles for taking all your food and lets you go.
9881:You kill the troll, but alas, in death it collapses the tunnel to the ruins entirely!{}{}{}{}Still, you gather some minerals from the entrance itself.  
9882:'You have a funny light about you, soothing type... {}{}{}{}You're so nice, can you help an old troll out? I got me a nasty splinter in my back, can't reach it for the life of me!'{}{}{}{}You see a huge two-handed spear stuck in its body. {}{}
9883:Pull it out with pure brawn.
9884:Use tools to pull it out. 
9885:'Who, what? You wake me, little creatures, you poke and probe, make my back ache again, make me hungry!'
9886:Tell it you'll give it food if it lets you explore the tunnels.
9887:Point out that the troll has a weapon sticking out of its back. 
9888:Convince the troll that you did it a favour because it was clearly asleep on the job. 
9889:'Mmm, tasty. You still can't go to the tunnels, but I give you some good stuff, here.'
9890:'Ah, yeah, the splinter, can't reach the thing. Say, would you?'
9891:'Hmm, yeah, you may be on to something here. Thanks!{}{}{}{}Here, have some minerals. You fleshies like that sort of thing. And no, you can't go into the tunnels.'
9892:The troll beats you badly, and for a moment, you think it will eat you, but instead it vomits a muddy, greenish goo all over you.{}{}{}{}It mumbles something about indigestion.{}{}
9893:'Ooh, ahh, nice. Can't let you into the tunnels, but here, have some goodies for your troubles.'{}{}
9894:'Argh! You make it worse. I eat you!'
9895:'Hmm, you are short like them... Alas, I cannot let you in, but I will give you some good stone and metal, as a mark of friendship.'
9896:'Argh, you make me angry, and hungry!'
9897:As you scour the elven ruins, you have the distinct feeling of being watched. Before long, you realise there are many bows aimed your way, and you hear:{}{}{}{}'What seek you here, intruder?'
9898:[Forest demon]Demand they put those bows away, for you are a woodland creature and thus their better!
9899:[Elf]Speak in the elven tongue to try to calm this situation.
9900:[Orc]Growl some insults at them, and say you'd rather not have to skin an elf today.
9901:Try to talk to them. Ask why they are aiming bows at you.
9902:'We guard a sacred spot, and we will not allow your presence to spoil its serenity. Do not test our resolve.'
9903:Assert that you follow the path of Dievanna, and say that surely even they respect her as one of their own.
9904:Convince them you were only going to take some useful resources from the ruins. You promise not to come close to the sacred place or destroy anything.
9905:Ask if you can visit the sacred place.
9906:'You follow the children's beliefs as if they were yours. Still, you are kin, so we will speak to you without violence.'
9907:Ask them what they are doing in the ruins.
9908:'Dzievva, the huntress, yes, young though she may be, is of our sort. We see now that you are worthy to test your mind and soul in the spring. {}{}{}{}Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back.{}{}{}{}Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
9909:Drink from the spring. 
9910:The spring water is refreshing and brisk. With every sip you feel your spirit lifted and your body rested. {}{}{}{}The blessings of the spring can be many or none, but you feel wonderful for trying it.{}{}{}{}The elves also grant you permission to search the ruins for usable resources -- without damaging anything, of course. 
9911:Give thanks to the spring and gather what you found.
9912:'These ruins are of no use to us. Whatever is left here, you may take and reuse. {}{}{}{}Do not damage the forest, remain far from the sacred spring, and do not disturb us again.'{}{}{}{}They disappear into the forest, but you know you are still being watched.
9913:Gather what you can find here and leave.
9914:'The sacred spring will not be disturbed on our watch. Leave now, and do not further test our peaceful resolve, for it is not our natural state.'
9915:You kill the elven guardians and are free to loot these ruins.{}{}{}{}However, when you approach the place they guarded, a small running spring, its waters turn black.
9916:Drink from the spring anyway. Then gather any loot and leave.
9917:Despite your defeat, the elves do not pursue you beyond their territory.{}{}
9918:'We are woodland kin, and this remains our home, at least while we guard the life waters here -- a sacred healing spot.{}{}{}{}As you well know, only the worthy may approach the spring, for it carries great danger as well as the promise of life.'
9919:Ask to be allowed the honour of being tested.
9920:[Wood folk]Ask to be allowed the honour of being tested.
9921:Insist that you should be allowed to be tested. 
9922:'You come here in the presence of orc filth, brethren. They have no respect for nature. They have a constant need for change, movement, violence. {}{}{}{}No, you cannot be granted the boon!'
9923:There is a long pause, during which you sense the elven egos fighting with their sense of duty. Finally, they speak up:{}{}{}{}'Apologies, woodland spirit. You had us confused, for you walk the path of the child gods as if they were your masters.'{}{}
9924:Ignore the slight, and ask why they dwell here still. 
9925:You will not suffer offense from such saplings as these. Attack!
9926:'You show much restraint for rabid pups. How quaint. {}{}{}{}Now, leave. This is no place for mongrels. We guard a sacred spot, and we will not allow your presence to spoil its serenity. Do not test our resolve.'
9927:Attack those pompous long-ears!
9928:'You speak well, and you are one of our own. We see now that you are worthy to test your mind and soul in the spring. {}{}{}{}Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back.{}{}{}{}Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
9929:'You speak well. We will make an exception and allow you to test your mind and soul in the spring. Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back.{}{}{}{}Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
9930:You kill the elven guardians and are free to loot these ruins.{}{}{}{}However, when you approach the place they guarded, a small running spring, its waters turn black, and you know the guardians must have cursed it with their dying breath.
9931:You observe the quiet remains of a once-great city and soon realise that among the fog walk the unliving and their breath is exuding toxic cloud.
9932:The unliving overwhelm you. You are forced to flee and  you may feel ill from their foul stench.
9933:Your plan worked. The unliving do not notice you, but you may feel ill from their foul stench.{}{}
9934:[Turmoil] Call upon turmoil and attack whoever dares to stand in your path!
9935:As you approach the other group, you realise too late that it is a striga waiting to ambush you!{}{}
9936:Allow it to bite you as you run away!
9937:Try to intimidate it.
9938:[Harmony or intellect] As harmony and intellect dictate, there must be a peaceful way out. These folks look hungry. Offer them food in exchange for letting you search the ruins as well. [Lose 20 food]
9939:You are strong. Intimidate them.
9940:'You seem like honest types, and we are hungry. Deal. {}{}{}{}And since we ain't stupid enough to mess with your gods, you can search to the south and west of here. Be careful of the east, though - the air seems foul there, and two of ours never came back to say what's hiding there.'{}{}
9941:You scout ahead and discover that it is not a group of people, but a striga waiting to ambush you!
9942:The striga is not impressed.
9943:The striga runs away, and you find remains of its previous victim. But the ruins were clearly looted many times over already.
9944:The burning light is overwhelming. It burns your very soul, threatening to dissolve it entirely and bind it to the ever-glowing presence. {}{}{}{}Just as you think you'll succumb, the light retreats, perhaps still too weak to fully take you.
9945:The striga runs away, and you find remains of its previous victim.
9946:You are sorely beaten and perhaps drop some of your stuff so they won't chase you.{}{}{}{}
9947:You search the old ruins until you realise that a dark, foreboding mist is descending upon this place. {}{}{}{}The black mist is a dreaded remnant of the days of darkness and here, in the lands of the elves, the taint hits with more potency.
9948:[Magic user] You have skilled wise ones with you. Battle this force of the dark with your spirit!
9949:You climb up to explore the old  ruins but hear an unsettling stirring in the forest. Darkness has clearly infected this place and some of the trees seem to be descending upon you accompanied by shadows.
9950:[Wood folk]Speak to the forest and proclaim your right to be here.
9951:[Turmoil or Magic] Call upon your connection to the dark and command this forest to stop!
9952:[Shadow Elf] Call out to the shadows and ask them to back down as you are kin.
9953:The shadows retreat and a leshy steps forward: {}{}{}{}'The shaadows will come again. Go now, we cannot hold them back.'
9954:Ask if you can help the leshy?
9955:The forest does not listen or respond. Its anger is old and raw and the shadows feed on it.{}{}
9956:The forest guardians and their shadow companions lie dead, so you are free to loot the ruins in peace. 
9957:'Noo, you cannot move my forest and I will not abandon it, even when the darkness consumes and changes. Us, do you see how fast I speak? Sad, so saad. {}{}{}{}But, perhaps change is good? Darkness is not evil, it is just, different. But you best go now, the mroki are veery temperamental.'{}{}
9958:You find the remains of a  settlement deep in the dark forest.
9959:These forest ruins, perhaps elven, look fairly fresh, likely abandoned due to the presence of darkness rather than age. The elves were evacuated, but you may still find some usable resources. 
9960:As you enter, you are surprised by some mroki!
9961:[Shadow elf] Ask them to back away, as your kin.
9962:[Magic user] Face them with your spirit.
9963:You deafeat the shadow kin. 
9964:Gather what you can from these ruins.
9965:The shadows engulf you and drain your spirit before you manage to run away.
9966:The mroki back away.
9967:'Shadow child, you forget darkness is chaos, today we choose to stand against you!'
9968:Reason with them.
9969:'Fine, we leave you be.'{}{}{}{}They disappear into shadow.{}{}
9970:They do not listen, only advance towards you.
9971:You come across the ruins of a town. It was torn asunder by the Shattering, clearly, but more than that, there is an odd light beaming from the gash. 
9972:[Hunter or perception]Search the place carefully.
9973:Search the ruins, despite the likely danger.
9974:You find tracks of people all going in one direction, away from this place. But their prints are odd, as if their steps were made in unison, like an army. Yet you see children, folk with injuries, and even dogs following the same pattern.
9975:Follow these tracks.
9976:Search this place. 
9977:You follow the tracks and find a group of folks, their eyes empty of light, their limbs slacking yet not slow. They stare at you and walk away, but a group of light wisps shoots your way!
9978:[Magic user] Fight them off with spirit!
9979:You defeat the light creatures and find no trace of the others. 
9980:The light burns your spirit badly. Your connection to the gods shields you, however, so eventually the light disappears.
9981:You search the ruins but find mostly white ash and some rubble. But the more you linger here, the more you feel an odd burning upon your spirit, as if something is trying to get in. 
9982:Resist it!
9983:You resist this assault and are able to move away.
9984:You find tracks of people all going in one direction, away from this place. But their walk is odd, as if their steps were made in unison, like an army - but you see children, folk with injuries and even dogs following the same pattern.
9985:You follow the tracks and find a group of folks, their eyes empty of light, their limbs slacking yet not slow. {}{}{}{}You spot a family running after them. The family looks rugged and battle worn, but one of their small children is too slow, so they have to stop. They are not light-taken, as far as you can tell.{}{}
9986:Ask them why they are chasing those light-taken?
9987:Pursue the light-taken, ignoring this family.
9988:You defeat the light creatures. Their bodies turn to white ash as they collapse.   
9989:You run past the family and catch up to the lightbringer group. They turn to you, stretch out their arms, and call out:{}{}{}{}'Come, come with us. Leave darkness behind, and enter light.'{}{}
9990:'Them light things, they offer peace. I met my auntie, she was light-taken and she was so calm and wise. She used to be a right bitchy sort, never smiled.{}{}{}{}We want to join them.'{}{}
9991:Convince them to turn away, for this light is not of divine origin. Attest to it as the chosen of the gods.
9992:[Light]In the name of holy light, scorn them for falling for such an unnatural lure. Tell them to turn back.
9993:Leave them be, follow the light-taken.
9994:They fall to the floor and bow to you:{}{}{}{}'We never meant to anger the gods. We thought light was surely their path. But you speak so well and you bear the sign of the chosen. We will go back home. And here is a gift for your wisdom.'{}{}
9995:They shrug:{}{}{}{}'You're a stranger. You may have the look of the chosen, but how do we know you are one, and not a demon? Light is good. We will go. Leave us be.'{}{}{}{}They move on, although the lightbringers are no longer in sight.{}{}
9996:'You there, what ya want here?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.
9997:Ask if you can visit the livestock trade.
9998:'Sure thing, let's deal, we may have some live'uns for ya.'{}{}
9999:Buy a surprise livestock.
10000:'There's always trouble about the place. Some slimy snakes set up a nest nearby. You kill them, we be friends for sure.'
10001:Ask if you can visit the slave trader. [A slave costs 7000 and the market will not always be here even if you do not buy, so only visit if you have the cash]
10002:Ask to sell some folk to them.
10003:'Sure, knock yourselves out, we ain't got the manpower to check it all.'
10004:'There's always trouble about the place. There's a nice rich patch of ground to scavenge, but damned rats have set up a nest and keep botherin' us. We're small, only setting up, so if you'll help us pacify the rats, we'll be very thankful, to be sure.'
10005:'Filthy gobbos set up camp nearby, and that scum wants our turf, for sure! You go stick them for us.'
10006:'A witch, that's what you're after, eh?{}{}Magic comes at a price. Healing the spirit is easier. Curses - well, they are nasty things, and they'll cost you more. Cost you blood.'
10007:'We have issues with predators roaming our turf. You asked if you could help?'
10008:'Bastard bandits set up a settlement near us. Soon they'll come knockin' on our doorstep, robbin' our shit. Get rid of them lot and we'll be mates for sure.'
10009:'Spiders took over a place nearby. Go clear it if you like to do stuff so much.'
10010:You party well -- too well for some. Afterward, the goblins keep to their word and leave.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are pleased with the result.{}{}
10011:The scavengers are furious:{}{}{}{}'What? Peace with them lot? Not likely and not what we asked for. You god folk, you all stick together - begone!'
10012:You find the snake nest the scavengers asked you to deal with.
10013:[Druid or Nature]You know snakes are susceptible to a certain flute melody, so use it to try to lead them away from this place.
10014:[Forest folk]Convince the snakes to leave.
10015:[Snake]You need to claim this territory. Any snakes will then move away. 
10016:[Hunter]Set up traps to thin the nest and thus chase the rest away.
10017:You are badly beaten. The scavengers have to come to your rescue, and they are not impressed.
10018:You play an entrancing melody and lead the snakes away from this area, and the scavengers are grateful for your aid. {}{}
10019:As you are leaving, a snake slithers after you, determined to become part of your group.
10020:Accept the snake and leave together.
10021:The snakes hiss in anger and turn your way.
10022:You will be bitten, but run.
10023:Your traps work, and any snakes that get away leave the area quickly. The scavengers appear: {}{}{}{}'I'll be damned, you chased them away. Wonderful! Here, have this as thanks.'
10024:Accept their thanks and leave.
10025:Your snake slithers forward and whispers to their kin. Whatever was said, the snakes leave. The scavengers soon appear:{}{}{}{}'I'll be damned, you chased them away. Wonderful! Here, have this as thanks.'
10026:You approach the area where the pack of wolves you were asked to deal with is said to roam.
10027:[Werewolf]Dominate the wolves.
10028:Use your meat to lure these animals away from the territory and hope they won't come back.
10029:You spot the pack running together, but they haven't seen you yet. 
10030:[Wolf]Run with the pack and convince them to move on.
10031:You have those who can communicate with wolves, so make the wolves obey you.
10032:Wolves respect territory. Try to figure out a way to mark this land for the scavengers, thus making the wolves leave.
10033:Set a trap for the pack and attack when they are weakened.
10034:You track the wolves to their lair. It is a cave with only one way in or out. {}{}{}{}You can set a trap here and kill them off one by one.
10035:You run with the wolves and lead them to a better patch of land. They thank you and do not return here.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
10036:Some of the wolves try to get away from your traps and bite you in their dying frenzy.{}{}
10037:You mark the territory and harass the pack for a time, so that in the end they move on.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
10038:You give the meat away and lead the animals to another spot. 
10039:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the animals returned to their spot and continued to harass the settlers. They have to deal with the wolves themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10040:You are unconvincing, so the beasts stay.
10041:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the wolf pack.{}{}{}{}The scavengers hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the wolves themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10042:The wolves bow to your dominance and depart. Perhaps one or two may even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are happy with your work.{}{}
10043:You run with the wolves and lead them to a better land, but they only take it as increasing their territory. {}{}{}{}You have their gratitude, but the scavengers are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10044:[Hunter]Set traps and lure the rats into them.
10045:[Druid]No need to kill. Try to coerce the rats to leave. 
10046:[Witch]Rats are your cohort. Dominate the vermin and make them leave.
10047:[Rat]Go in alone and convince your vermin kin to leave this place.
10048:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods, hoping to threaten with the might of man and divinity. {}{}{}{}The rats listen and scamper away obediently, leaving you free to loot their nest. 
10049:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods, hoping to threaten with the might of man and divinity.{}{}{}{}But the fat rat in charge is not buying it. You are bitten and thrown out. The nest is unsettled.
10050:You barge into the nest and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods, hoping to threaten with the might of man and divinity.{}{}{}{}The rats listen so well, they want you to be their pack master now. You would lead your own nest, have many baby rats, and bring the word of the gods to the vermin.
10051:You set the traps and get rid of the vermin. {}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and leave a reward.
10052:You find many bodies of children, but also demons and animals. Most are dead. This nest was busy.{}{}{}{}What is more surprising, you discover in a central space, upon a throne of bones, a commo cat, bound in a collar. It remains unclear if it was the master or the victim here.{}{}{}{}It purrs at you.
10053:Kill the cat. It's clearly the architect of this evil!
10054:You set up traps and kill most of the rats, and the others scamper away. In one of your traps you discover a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. {}{}
10055:The rats get spooked and swarm you within minutes. The scavengers have to come to your rescue and they are not impressed with your 'help.'
10056:Your friend is distraught by your actions but the nest scampers away in fear.
10057:The rats listen and scamper away from the village. Nature and Harmony are satisfied by your actions. The scavengers thank you and leave a reward.
10058:The rats listen and scamper away from the village.{}{}{}{}The villagers thank you and leave a reward.
10059:The rats listen and scamper away from the village. The scavengers thank you and leave a reward.
10060:You get in closer and observe the rats. You soon realise that they are unusual. They seem to be building a prison of sorts -- there are cages and holes, and you see bodies of their prisoners sticking out.{}{}
10061:The villagers thank you for clearing the nest and leave a reward.
10062:The rats beat you badly and force you to flee. The villagers have to come to your rescue and they are not impressed with your 'help.'
10063:The nest is cleared. The villagers thank you and leave a reward.
10064:The nest is cleared. The scavengers thank you and leave a reward.
10065:The vermin are dead or running away. You discover that one of the bodies was a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. {}{}
10066:The rats listen to your tune and obediently abandon their nest. You discover that one of them was actually a cradlepossum -- an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. Most likely, it was not taken by the flute but rather decided to flee while it could.{}{}
10067:The rats follow the tune and drown. The scavengers thank you and leave a reward.
10068:You spot the bandit camp that the scavengers asked you to clear. 
10069:[Bandit or intelligence]Try to convince them that neither you nor the scavengers are worth the trouble, and point them to an area where more profit may lie.
10070:[Intellect and Harmony]Try to parley with the bandits and convince them that fighting will bring no profit now that you are involved. 
10071:Pay the bandits to leave this place.
10072:[Hunter or perception]These bandits seem determined to hunt for scavengers. Plant false tracks to lead them away from this piece of land.
10073:'I see, yeah, good tip that, thanks. Nothin' worse than wastin' time. Safe travels to you, friend.'
10074:Wish them well and leave. 
10075:The bandits even leave a gift for you before they go.
10076:'Bah, you talk too much, but you do make sense. We will leave.'
10077:Turns out there is no honour among thieves -- the bandits return to their turf. {}{}{}{}The scavengers are not happy with you.
10078:You fail to fool the bandits. They don't look too impressed with you.
10079:Pay them off!
10080:Your misdirection works and the bandits move away. You dealt with the problem as asked, so you gain friendship.{}{}
10081:The scavengers hear of your failure. They have to kill the bandits themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10082:'True, you do look like more trouble than them lot. Then again, you look well off. You pay us, we move out.'
10083:You come to ruins occupied by spiders. These must be the ones the scavengers asked you to clear.
10084:You know how to handle beasts. Try to figure it out.
10085:[Hunter]Use tracking to find where their nest lies.
10086:Offer the spider queen food in exchange for them leaving. Say that these ruins will not be peaceful for them anyway with the scavengers seeking to claim them.
10087:Knowing the habits of beasts, you quickly identify the main nest where the spider queen likely dwells.
10088:[Spider]Go speak to your kin and convince them that this is a rubbish place to stay.
10089:You have those who can communicate with spiders. Talk to them.
10090:Spiders dislike smoke, and fire can destroy their webs.
10091:Use this advantage to attack!
10092:You find the spider queen nestled in a small tunnel in the ruins. You can block the exits and suffocate the spiders with smoke.{}{}
10093:You weave a tale of succulent prey and gloriously dark dungeons that would befit such a grand queen. She listens and leaves, looking for greener pastures. {}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
10094:Some of the spiders try to get away from your trap and bite you in their dying frenzy.{}{}
10095:You manage to smoke the spiders out of their nests and burn their webs so they are forced to abandon this territory.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the scavengers are grateful.{}{}
10096:You give the food away and the spider queen leaves with her nest as promised.
10097:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the spiders returned to their spot and continued to harass the settlers. They have to deal with the spiders themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10098:You are unconvincing, so the spiders stay.
10099:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the spider queen.{}{}{}{}The scavengers hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the spiders themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10100:The spider queen bows to your dominance and departs with her spiders. Perhaps one or two may even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The scavengers are happy with your work.{}{}
10101:The scavengers hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the spiders themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10102:Your spider tried to convince the others to leave, but the queen's offer was superior, and your friend stayed with their new queen!{}{}{}{}The scavengers have to deal with the problem themselves and are not impressed with your work.{}{}
10103:As spider queen, you claim dominance over a mere nest. You order the workers to abandon this site and never return to your territory. They obey.{}{}
10104:An armed group of scavengers stands before you.
10105:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the animals returned to their tower. The scavengers have to deal with the beasts themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10106:The crows seem to listen to your wisdom at first, but later you discover they only moved their nest deeper into the tower, making it even more dangerous for the scavengers to loot this place. {}{}{}{}They are not impressed with you.{}{}
10107:Most of this quarry has collapsed into a deep ravine, but there still may be some usable resources here.
10108:As harmony and intellect dictate, there must be a peaceful way out. These folks look hungry. Offer them food in exchange for letting you search the ruins as well. [Lose 20 [R7]food]
10109:'Sell some folk you say, yeah you look like you may have too many, eh? {}{}{}{}We ain't rich, but we can offer you a fair price.'
10110:Sell someone for good bones. [Min 30]
10111:Sell someone for a guaranteed strong pet. [Horse or carrier goat]
10112:Sell someone for a pack of strong tools. [Min 1 gathering and 1 crafting]
10113:Sell someone for good stone. [Min 30]
10114:Sell someone for a scavenger witch. [One time only]
10115:On a shallow reef, you see a shipwreck. 
10116:Swim over to check for anything useful.
10117:The ship is old and seems to have belonged to goblins, judging by the style. {}{}{}{}Their handiwork is known to survive harsh conditions, so perhaps you can find something of use. But packs of sea creatures are swarming the deck, so you'll need to be rid of them first.
10118:Kill the fish.
10119:[Hunter]Hunt the fish.
10120:[Water demon]Salt water is bad. But jump in quick and take what you can -- the little fish won't bother you.
10121:With the fish gone, you swim to the deck and search for any goods. {}{}{}{}You spot a carved chest, and sitting by it, you see a ghost, staring hopelessly into the depths of the sea before him.
10122:Take the chest and ignore the ghost.
10123:Take the chest and gesture for the ghost to come up and speak to you.
10124:The ghost appears on your ship: {}{}{}{}'Why do you call me here? I cannot come with you. I am bound here because I failed to guide my friends through the spirit storm. They are gone now, but I remain.'
10125:[Goblin shaman]Tell him you can bind him to your service instead if he likes. It isn't right that he should be stuck here for so long, even if the penance was deserved. 
10126:Does he know what he was bound to? Perhaps now that you are here, he could serve you and so wash away the failure.
10127:'Yes, we could try. But I warn you, whatever force keeps me here, it could curse you.'
10128:[Magic user]Say that you will try to do it in the safest way possible. 
10129:Nod and tell him you will try anyway.
10130:Retreat and say that you will not risk it. Bid him farewell.
10131:The ghost flickers and disappears, and you feel a curse upon you. 
10132:The fish beat you badly and force you to flee.
10133:You search the shipwreck and see that it is very recent. In fact, you can see something or someone struggling to swim to the surface, but they are being attacked by swarms of nasty fish!
10134:Help them and attack the fish.
10135:Throw some meat from your boat to lure the fish away from the person.
10136:Use this opportunity to pillage the shipwreck without fighting the fish. 
10137:You've heroically rescued...a dog.
10138:Well, good. Loot the ship also and leave.
10139:You've heroically rescued?.?.?.?a cat.
10140:'Yes, you I will serve willingly, and I trust you can make this transition safe for us both. Let us leave this wretched shipwreck.'
10141:You've heroically rescued ... a dog.
10142:You've heroically rescued...a cat.
10143:The ship is old and seems to have belonged to orcs, judging by the crude style. {}{}{}{}Orcs are known for their sturdy metalwork, so perhaps something survived this crash. But packs of sea creatures are swarming the deck, so you'll need to get rid of them first.
10144:With the fish gone, you swim to the deck and search for goods. {}{}{}{}You spot several corpses picked clean by the fish. You also see a wraith, aimlessly roaming the deck. 
10145:Ignore the wraith and loot what you can.
10146:The wraith does not seem instantly aggressive. Perhaps there is a way to capture it. Go in and try.
10147:[Witch]Examine the remains. Perhaps someone here controlled the wraith.
10148:Examine the wraith. Perhaps there is an object here that controls its existence.
10149:You see one of the fallen orcs holding a totem of sorts. This was likely an orc witch, and the object may help you control this wraith - or it may hurt you. It is never safe to meddle with a dead witch's belongings. 
10150:[Magic user]Take the totem and try to control its magic.
10151:Take the totem and see what happens.
10152:Retreat and just loot this place.
10153:The totem pierces your skin and makes you ill as the wraith disappears.
10154:You've heroically rescued...a trained wolf.
10155:You've heroically rescued...a trained bear.
10156:You spot a totem in the hands of a fallen orc witch. You can take it and thus control this wretched being. 
10157:Loot the place and leave.
10158:You spot a shipwreck sitting atop some rocks. 
10159:Ignore it.
10160:The vessel was large and likely still holds some treasures. 
10161:[Unliving]Observe it. 
10162:[Magic user]Get a sense of this ship first.
10163:You spot unnatural movement aboard. The unliving likely haunt this ship.
10164:[Magic user]Some dark magic lingers here. Prepare a ritual to cleanse this place and thus release these poor souls. 
10165:[Unliving]They will likely attack only warm-blooded creatures. Go in carefully and loot the place.
10166:The dark spell is broken and the unliving collapse. Their souls are free now. 
10167:Loot the ship and leave.
10168:Whatever dark magic is at work here is too strong for you, and you feel its power affect you. 
10169:The unliving are beaten and should not get up for a time. 
10170:The unliving beat you badly and force you to flee.
10171:You go in and loot the ship without the unliving noticing your presence.
10172:Your unliving kin are bound to this shipwreck. They will attack any living soul that approaches.
10173:The unliving are bound by a dark spell to this shipwreck. They will attack any living soul that approaches.
10174:You go in and quickly realise that you are surrounded by the unliving!
10175:Try to escape.
10176:You manage to run before they get to you.
10177:You manage to escape but not without scrapes. 
10178:You stopped running. What now?
10179:Keep running!
10180:The waters are calm, the skies clear, and you hear a faint yet alluring song carried on the waves. 
10181:[Magic user]There is magic at work here. Prepare yourself for an attack.
10182:[Water demon or syrin]You know this trick - an enchanted song to lure victims into a trap. Nasty sea creatures copying your style. Stay ready for this poor excuse for entrapment.
10183:The closer you get to the song, the stronger you feel the magic that accompanies it, but even with the knowledge, you will have to fight this enchantment. {}{}{}{}You see several sea demons surround your boat and circle as they sing. Because you were prepared, you can try to attack them physically also.{}{}
10184:Fight this enchantment!
10185:Fight them with your own spirit!
10186:Shout out to these sea demonettes and tell them to stop this nonsense!
10187:You break through the enchantment and see three very surprised sea demons staring at you. They blink a few times, then smile:{}{}{}{}'You broke free, so you can see the true faces of us three. May the seas reward you.'{}{}{}{}They swim away but blow you a sweet kiss. 
10188:You kill the sea demons and loot their fishy bodies. Upon examination, they were likely the czytlica, which are half-fish, half-human females, known to drag their victims to their deep underworld lairs.
10189:The sea demons swarm your boat and feed on your spirit energy. They also drag one of you into the depths of the sea!{}{}{}{}But, sometime later, the sea carries a child for you, likely born out of the sea demons' mischief.
10190:The sea demons swarm your boat and feed on your spirit energy. They try to drag one of you into the water, but luckily manage to take only a backpack.
10191:You break through the enchantment and see three very surprised sea demons staring at you. They blink a few times, then smile:{}{}{}{}'You broke free. You're like us? But you live in those small teardrops you call lakes and rivers. How sad.'{}{}{}{}They swim away but blow you a sweet kiss. 
10192:'You're like us? But you live in those small teardrops you call lakes and rivers. How sad. We shall not take you, for it would be no fun at all.'{}{}
10193:Ask them what they are?
10194:Swim away.
10195:'We are named czytlica. Some call us sirens too, but this may be because of your syrin who sings our songs on land.{}{}{}{}The jurata, our queens, claimed the seas when the earth broke. Now we are masters here, away from the land and your small ponds.'
10196:[Syrin]Yes, it seems you two do share something, although they seem more like your angry sisters the alkhonost. Still, wish them well and depart.
10197:[Vodnik]Preposterous. Underwater is your domain, and no queen claims dominion. Rubbish!
10198:Nod and thank them for their time, then swim away.
10199:'We like you. Here, have this gift. May the sea waters stay calm for your journey!'
10200:'Would you like to meet our queen and say that to her face? We warn you, it will not be nice.'
10201:Yes, accept the challenge!
10202:No, say that you did not mean to offend and thank them for not fighting. After all, water demons should stick together.
10203:The jurata queen comes in all her sea glory, but in the end, she bows to your seniority:{}{}{}{}'I am but a young queen, and you a seasoned lord. I shall pay tribute to your domain and watch your ship go safe through my waters. Be well, king.'
10204:Bow to her in thanks.
10205:Nod to your subject.
10206:The jurata queen comes in all her sea glory:{}{}{}{}'I am but a young queen, and you a seasoned lord. Yet it is my youth and power that surpasses your old traditions! Now bow to me, or die.'{}{}{}{}Her words carry a command that you know will break you. She truly is the queen of these waters.
10207:Bow down to her and offer tribute.
10208:Defy her, even if it means death!
10209:'I accept your tribute, prince of the sweet waters. You may leave.'
10210:'How bold and defiant. You will be one of my lovers, yes.'{}{}{}{}She clicks her fingers, and you follow her into the depths of your new home, forsaking all else.{}{}{}{}'And you, you nurtured such a specimen. You shall take my child and show it your strange world. Now leave.'
10211:Leave, if you have enough folk to do so.
10212:You feel that the demons drained some of your spirit while you talked, but then stopped.{}{}{}{}'You're like us? But you live in those small teardrops you call lakes and rivers. How sad. We shall not take you, if you pay us tribute. Or you could willingly join us for some fun. We don't guarantee safety, though.' They giggle and jump through some hoops in the water.{}{}
10213:Pay if you can.
10214:Say that you cannot pay, so you will join the 'fun.'
10215:'Good, we accept.'{}{}
10216:Sea water does not agree with you, and you feel sick from the mad dance the czytlica demons draw you into. {}{}{}{}You do not recall what happened next, only that you are happy to have woken up on the boat again.
10217:Sea water does not agree with you, and you feel sick from the mad dance the czytlica demons draw you into. {}{}{}{}You do not recall what happened next, only that one of you is gone. Sometime later, the sea carries a child for you, likely born out of the sea demons' mischief.
10218:The closer you get to the song, the stronger you feel the magic that accompanies it, but even with the knowledge, you will have to fight this enchantment. {}{}{}{}You see several sea demons surround your boat and circle as they sing. {}{}
10219:Fight this enchantment with your spirit!
10220:Try to resist with your mind!
10221:The ship is old and seems to have belonged to orcs, judging by the crude style. {}{}{}{}Orcs are known for their sturdy metalwork. Perhaps something survived the crash. But there are some small fish and a larger shape swimming here.
10222:Kill the creatures.
10223:The larger shape seems humanoid. Try to call out to it and say that you do not wish to fight.
10224:The fish turned out to be a sea demon in the shape of a part-woman, part-fish creature. She is dead now and you are free to loot.{}{}{}{}You spot several corpses picked clean by the fish. You also see a wraith aimlessly roaming the deck. 
10225:The wraith observes you but does not attack. It seems almost tired. It wails and screeches, but as long as you do not come too close, it ignores you.
10226:The creature swims up to the surface. Her body is part fish and part woman, and her voice melodic:{}{}{}{}'You do not wish to harm me? But I was the one who sunk this boat, so I assumed you came to avenge them.'
10227:[Orc]Now that she mentions it, yes! Attack her.
10228:Ask why she stuck around on her own if she thought she would be attacked.
10229:Say that you do not care, you are here to loot and she'd better stay away.
10230:'I cannot leave. This was my initiation. I did it well, but...Well, I was supposed to bring a certain private part of the captain as a trophy - he was a male, you see, unusual for orcs. It is a stupid joke by my sisters, but made law by their words spoken officially.'
10231:And?
10232:'That damned captain got a whiff of my plan, or maybe it was just chance, but he locked himself in the cabin when the ship went down and there's a bloody ghost there now, and I am not good with ghosts.'
10233:If you deal with the ghost, will she pay you?
10234:'Oh, right, go right ahead then.'{}{}{}{}She swims away.
10235:Loot the place, avoiding any ghosts, and leave.
10236:'Yes, I will give you a precious artefact I found.'
10237:Agree to deal with the ghost.
10238:'Good, I will leave you the present and watch from afar. We will not talk again, but I wish you good winds and quiet waters.' She disappears into the waves and a bundle floats your way.{}{}{}{}You swim to the shipwreck and spot several corpses picked clean by the fish. You also see a wraith aimlessly roaming the deck. 
10239:No one answers.
10240:You spot some debris floating amongst the rocks. The water is fairly calm, but the rocks are very sharp, and space between them is tight.{}{}{}{}You can try to swim for the potential loot with or without your boat. 
10241:Take the boat in, slowly. 
10242:Swim by yourselves.
10243:[Water demon]Salt water does not serve you well, but apart from feeling sick, the swim should be no issue for you.
10244:You manoeuver the boat well enough to get to the debris and gather what you can. 
10245:Your boat is damaged and sinks!
10246:Swim to the shore as fast as you can!
10247:The rocks prove to be razor sharp and the waters not as calm as you thought. You get pretty banged up and swim back to your boat.
10248:The rocks prove to be razor sharp and the waters not as calm as you thought. You get pretty banged up and swim back to your boat. You lose some of your equipment too.
10249:As you plough through a stormy patch on the seas, you are caught by an unexpected gust of wind that assails your deck, as if trying to get inside.{}{}{}{}Your boat is becoming really unsteady as a result, and there are rocks ahead.
10250:[Forest demon]Viatroviec? Tell them to calm themselves and stop embarrassing your kind, then ask what is wrong.
10251:[Wisdom]Observe this strange storm for a while. 
10252:Manoeuver the boat and deal with the odd wind after.
10253:Attack the wind thing and hope to have it gone before you hit the rocks!
10254:The wind calms and your boat is steady again. The viatroviec speaks up:{}{}{}{}'Oh, thank the forest, a friendly face! I got lost in the winds and blown into this wretched thing humans call the sea. It is so vast, no trees...I know I am made of wind, but I was born to roam the land, not this!'
10255:Say that you understand, but he cannot just assault any boat he sees. He could have gotten himself or you killed.
10256:Tell him to get off your boat now. 
10257:'Oh, yes. I am sorry. Will you take me home?'
10258:Agree, but offer him a better home by your side, in service of the gods, that will teach him to be comfortable even at sea.
10259:'Thank you, I will hide below deck. Let me out when we reach land. Here, I found this before I got lost here - a gift to say thank you.'
10260:Thank him and continue your journey.
10261:'No, no, no, you try to trick me, I don't want to stay anymore!'{}{}{}{}He flies away with the wind again, but at least far from your boat.
10262:'Thank you, I will do as you say, follow your lead, yes. And here, a thing I found before, my first gift to you as new friends.'
10263:'Fine, fine, off I go, lost at sea, gone forever, cruel fate?.?.?.'{}{}{}{}He flies away with the wind again, but at least far from your boat.
10264:You manage to steer the boat free of the rocks and the odd gust of wind seems to have calmed. You can now see it has a vaguely humanoid shape, likely a viatroviec demon.{}{}{}{}Seeing that it almost made you crash, it cries out an apology and flies away.
10265:You kill what must have been a wind demon, but it took too long and your boat hit some of the rocks. You lose some equipment and get some bruises. 
10266:You surrender just in time to feel your boat hit a rock. The impact makes some of you ill and some equipment could have fallen overboard. The wind creature shouts:{}{}{}{}'Hey, hey, I never wanted to fight. I just want to get back to land, and this boat will crash if you keep at it. I'll help you, but you have to give me some of your spirit to make me stronger so we can swim past the rocks.'
10267:Agree to work with the creature. 
10268:Refuse and take your chances on the rocks.
10269:You lose the fight and your boat crashes on the rocks. But at least the wind creature flies away.
10270:This could be a demon because, despite the storm, this is not how wind should behave.{}{}
10271:Try calling out to whatever it may be. 
10272:Attack whatever this is.
10273:'You, you speak to me? I am viatroviec. I got lost in the winds and blown into this wretched thing humans call the sea. It is so vast, no trees...I know I am made of wind, but I was born to roam the land, not this! I will stop causing you trouble, but will you please take me home? Any land will do.'
10274:Agree to let him stay on the ship until you reach land.
10275:No, tell him to leave, now!
10276:You fail to manoeuver your boat and it crashes on the rocks. But at least the wind creature flies away.
10277:You try to deal with whatever this wind is, but it does not calm, and your boat crashes against the rocks.
10278:The creature wails in sorrow but flies away. You see the storm swallow it. But your boat is back to normal, and you are able to swim away in peace.
10279:'You are good, you are safe, and your Stribog, he is like me, only greater. I will come with you now.'
10280:Welcome him.
10281:'You are good, you are safe, and one of your gods is that of wind, yes? I will come with you now.'
10282:The demon feeds on your spirit and is then able to calm the storm. You swim back out to safety and the creature speaks again:{}{}{}{}'I have fed and am strong enough to find my home now. I am sorry for the trouble. Bye.'{}{}{}{}He flies away. 
10283:The demon turns back to you: {}{}{}{}'You are good, you are safe, and one of your gods is that of wind, yes? I will come with you now.'
10284:You kill the demon, and the winds calm in time for you to manoeuver your boat to safety. 
10285:You spot the remains of a larger vessel, likely a cargo ship of some sort - perhaps slavers or traders. {}{}{}{}The ship is in pieces. There is still blood in the water and a lot of predatory sea life circling it. If you get too close, you will have to fight the creatures.
10286:[Hunter]Lure the creatures away from the boat with meat.
10287:[Water demon]Lure the creatures away from the boat with an enchanted song.
10288:Go in and attack!
10289:You lure the predators away from the cargo ship and are free to search it now. 
10290:Take what is salvageable and leave.
10291:You lure the predators away, but not without them biting you a few times. Worse yet, the boat has nothing much of use left on it.
10292:The predators are dead and you are free to search the debris now. 
10293:The predators beat you badly and chase you away from their turf. You get soaked in water and fall ill afterward.
10294:You spot the remains of a larger vessel, likely a cargo ship of some sort - perhaps slavers or traders. {}{}{}{}The ship is in pieces. There is still blood in the water and you spot a shark circling it. 
10295:[Hunter]Lure the shark away with meat.
10296:[Water demon]Swim with the shark. You may not like sea water, but you hear these big fish can be tamed in this way.
10297:You lure the shark away from the cargo ship and are free to search it now. 
10298:The shark eats your meat, but it outsmarts you and gets a few bites of your flesh too. You have to drop some of your equipment to escape.
10299:The shark is dead and you are free to search the debris now. 
10300:The shark proves too smart and fast, and it drags one of you down into the sea.
10301:You swim with the shark, but it turns out that it's not as fun as they say. The big fish chases you and bites you and the sea water makes you sick.
10302:Clouds darken, waves rise - a storm is coming!
10303:[Stribog]Ask your lord to guide you through the storm.
10304:[Nature]Pray to Stribog to guide you through these rough waters.
10305:Pray to Stribog to guide you through these rough waters.
10306:[Water demon]The sea is a wild place, but you have adapted to it. Jump in the water and guide the ship yourself.
10307:Hold on to something and try to weather the storm.
10308:These waters are wild and unruly. Even your nature struggles to hold on, although you feel a surge of strength as if the sea itself recognises your kinship. {}{}{}{}You must try to weather this storm. 
10309:You hold on and weather the storm well enough, but not without losing some equipment. 
10310:Journey on.
10311:You hold on and weather the storm. In the deep, troubled waters, you discover the wreckage of a ship to plunder.
10312:In the wreckage, you find a dog still clinging to life.
10313:Take the dog, search the wreckage, and leave.
10314:The winds favour your path and carry you away from the storm. You feel Stribog's blessing upon you. 
10315:The storm does not ease. You feel that Stribog's grace has not blessed you on this day. {}{}{}{}You lose some of your equipment, and some of you fall ill.
10316:You find a path to safety, and in the deep, troubled waters, you discover the wreckage of a ship to plunder.
10317:The trader's stalls stand open for you.   {}{}
10318:The trader's stalls stand open for you.  
10319:'We are done, please leave us now.'
10320:You enter the lands of the shadowkin and you feel the raw presence of darkness here. A thick, low hanging black mist covers the ground to you can never see your feet. And another such layer, albeit thinner, shrouds the sky. A voice from the shadow speaks:{}{}{}{}'Why do you come seeking darkness? Do you wish yourself changed, or are you here to try and cast us out?'{}{}{}{}
10321:[Light or harmony] You feel extremely uneasy here. But assure them you are not an enemy, you simply wish to talk and visit.
10322:[Elf] This is where your cursed brethren, the shadow elves now live. This darkness makes you ill. But, say that you are here without prejudice and wish only to visit.
10323:[Turmoil or magic] You feel your domain strong here. Tell the inhabitants you wish to talk and you are not an enemy.
10324:[Orc] As creature born of darkness, you feel at home here. Say that you are here merely to visit.
10325:Tell the voice you wish to enter the settlement, not to fight.
10326:[Demon] All demons are born of magic and that in turn is steeped in darkness by nature, thus you are not here to fight them without reason. 
10327:[Shadow Elf] Say you are here as kin and only wish to visit. 
10328:'Follower of the path of stagnation. You best stay clear of our heart, or risk yours blackened. Or perhaps that is your wish? {}{}{}{}You may enter, but at your own peril and know that fate is in turmoil in our home and we will not aid you if it wishes to play games.'
10329:Turn back.
10330:'A child of light graces us with their presence, do you wish to become shadowkin? Are you curious how we turned out curse into a new path? You are welcome to join, darkness is open to all. You could die, of course... {}{}{}{}Enter, but at your own peril and know that fate is in turmoil in our home and we will not aid you if it wishes to play games.'
10331:Say that you do want to be changed into shadow kin.
10332:Tell them your elven child will embrace the path of the shadow if their offer is true?
10333:Enter then, embrace darkness, brethren and I shall guide you onto your new path. 
10334:Enter then, embrace darkness, brethren and I shall guide our young friend to a dark and beautiful fate. Come child, follow me.
10335:Darkness weighs heavy on your nature, but you get through and enter the city, situated within a hidden cave. {}{}{}{}Here, you can visit a few places that are open to outsiders.{}{}{}{}
10336:There is a town hall of sorts, where the people pay their dues , they do this by giving away dark energy, so you can actually get rid of your curses this way. 
10337:A herbalist hut is interested in toxins, they will drain yours, but the procedure isn't entirely safe.
10338:A witch is offering to sell some her familiars to you. 
10339:Simply enjoy the visit, talk to people and rest.
10340:'Here, have a look at my lot, some of them young ones are ready to find new masters.'
10341:Buy a cat.
10342:Buy a crow.
10343:Buy a spider.
10344:Perhaps another time. Leave.
10345:You were blessed when you entered but darkness twisted the light of the blessings and  left you empty. {}{}{}{}You can, however, enter the town now.
10346:Enter.
10347:Darkness is a force of change and some say, corruption. One of your women had a mark of the dark arts upon her and the black mist awakened it, transforming her into a witch.{}{}{}{}You can, however, enter the town now.
10348:The black mist seeps deep into one of your souls, leaving it cursed and you are unable to enter the settlement for now.
10349:'Ah, followers of the darker paths. Good. Beware though, darkness is not one to throw many favours, seeing as you are no friends of ours, you will still need to face the black mists whims if you wish to come in.'
10350:Speak to the people, perhaps someone would like to join the path of the cosmic tree?
10351:'You have proven a friend to the shadows, perhaps one of us  will follow you, but only if you make it worthwhile for all of us. We will also accept a child in exchange for our service. We are not idealists, we need to survive. Both deals are one time only.'
10352:Pay to recruit a shadow elf.
10353:Offer an exchange, one of your for one of theirs.
10354:There is no one interested. Leave.
10355:You enter the lands of the shadowkin and you feel the raw presence of darkness here. A thick, low hanging black mist covers the ground to you can never see your feet. And another such layer, albeit thinner, shrouds the sky. A voice from the shadow speaks:{}{}{}{}'Friend, enter and we shall shield you from our darkness.'
10356:Visit the town.
10357:'Yes, this is acceptable. The young one will learn our ways and one of us will join you.'
10358:You enter one of the dark caves and within, a creature of darkness welcomes you. They share their energy with you and your dark gifts are awakened. You become a witch.{}{}{}{}You can also visit the settlement now. 
10359:'Ah, a child born of darkness, much like us, only more - primal. What do you seek from us? If you are here to visit, enter, darkness will not harm you, probably...'
10360:One of your orc females has the dark taint of magic upon her, even though she is untrained. The shadowkin offer to awaken those gifts ad transform her into a witch.
10361:'Ah, followers of the darker paths. Good. Beware though, darkness is not one to throw many favours, seeing as you are no friends of ours, you will still need to face the black mists whims if you wish to come in.''
10362:'You best stay clear of our heart, or risk yours blackened. Or perhaps that is your wish? {}{}{}{}You may enter, but at your own peril and know that fate is in turmoil in our home and we will not aid you if it wishes to play games.'
10363:'Welcome shadow kin, this was your home, yet you chose to leave, so be weary of the whimsy of your old family.  If you are here to visit, enter, darkness will not harm you, probably...'
10364:Say you would like one of your elven children to walk the path of shadow. 
10365:The dark town is laid to ruin and you can loot it, but beware, darkness lingers here and will likely infect you.
10366:Leave without looting.
10367:Loot and leave.
10368:Darkness is a force of change and some say, corruption. One of your women had a mark of the dark arts upon her and the black mist awakened it, transforming her into a witch.{}{}{}{}You were able to recover some useful resources, but most of the town seems to have fallen into instant ruin when you killed the shadow folk.{}{}{}{}
10369:The black mist seeps deep into one of your souls, leaving it cursed.{}{}{}{}You were able to recover some useful resources, but most of the town seems to have fallen into instant ruin when you killed the shadow folk.
10370:The darkness does not harm you.{}{}{}{}You were able to recover some useful resources, but most of the town seems to have fallen into instant ruin when you killed the shadow folk.
10371:You were badly beaten and darkness seeps deep into your souls as you flee.
10372:You realise the shadows are following you!
10373:Try to talk your way out of this.
10374:You defeat the shadowkin.{}{}
10375:The shadowkin defeat you and infect you with darkness before you manage to escape.
10376:The shadows move away.
10377:You stay for a while and help the goblins heal. {}{}{}{}'Oh, thank you, thank you kindly. We will leave now as promised, but thanks to you we actually have a chance to live on. Here, have this, not much, but all we can give.'
10378:The goblins are grateful for your mercy. They stay to heal their wounds, which may take some time.{}{}{}{}'Oh, thank you, thank you kindly. Here, a small token of thanks.'
10379:Through nature or intellect, use your mental prowess to figure out what to do. 
10380:Use your own meat to lure these animals away from the area and hope they won't come back.
10381:You spot the pack running together. They haven't seen you yet. 
10382:Your group includes those who can communicate with wolves, so make the creatures obey you.
10383:Wolves respect territory. Try to figure out a way to mark this land for the Slavyans, thus making the wolves leave.
10384:You track the wolves to their lair, a cave with only one way in and out. {}{}{}{}You can set a trap here and kill them off one by one.
10385:You run with the wolves and lead them to a better patch of land. They thank you and do not return.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the Slavyans are grateful.{}{}
10386:You mark the territory and harass the pack until they move on.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the Slavyans are grateful.{}{} 
10387:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the wolves have returned and continue to harass the settlers. They have to deal with the wolves themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10388:You were unconvincing, and the beasts stay.
10389:Your scheming fails, and you are assailed by the wolfpack.{}{}{}{}The folk who asked for your help hear your screams and come to your aid. They kill the wolves themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10390:The wolves bow to your dominance and depart. Perhaps one or two even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are happy with your work.{}{}
10391:The folk who asked for your help hear of your failure and come to your aid. They kill the wolves themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10392:You run with the wolves and lead them to a better land, but they take it as increasing their territory. {}{}{}{}You have their gratitude, but the Slavyans are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10393:'Ah, fine, fine, we ain't gonna shit on our friends' doorstep, we'll find a new patch.'{}{}{}{}You dealt with the problem as asked, and you gain friendship.{}{}
10394:You find the small graveyard where the Slavyans think the unliving roam.
10395:[Magic user or Magic] Some dark magic may be at work here. Investigate.
10396:You have folk who know about the unliving, so take a closer look.
10397:Through nature and light, cleanse this place of the foul force that violates the laws of your gods.
10398:Bribe the unliving with meat so they move on.
10399:You spot several unliving corpses walking in circles around a single gravestone.
10400:[Unliving]Ask them to move along or leave the villagers be.
10401:Perform a ritual that will keep the unliving trapped here. This is dark magic, so it may cost you something, but it should work.
10402:You caught them by surprise, so attack!
10403:A stench of dark magic hits your senses and you discover a cursed figurine atop one of the gravestones was causing the unliving to rise. {}{}{}{}It is easy to destroy, but doing so will wound your spirit.
10404:Destroy the object.
10405:Turns out the unliving were called here by a cursed object, but your words are able to snap them out of the trance. They are grateful and do as you wish. {}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow. {}{}
10406:The unliving scatter and even leave some of their stuff behind. {}{}
10407:The smell of fresh meat entices the unliving. You see them thrashing about to get it, and although they had trouble moving away from the graveyard at first, they follow the meat and eventually just wander off.
10408:You are about to report your success when you realise that a dark force is making more bodies rise up, and some of the ones who left return too.{}{}{}{}They are eventually beaten by the villagers without your help, and your friendship suffers for it.
10409:Your efforts fail and the unliving turn their attention to you.
10410:You bind the unliving to this grave site, and unless someone purposefully breaks your work, they will remain here. {}{}{}{}The Slavyans are unsure about how they feel about this new feature, but you did deal with their immediate problem, and they are grateful.  {}{}{}{}
10411:The folk who asked for your help hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the unliving themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10412:Turns out the unliving were called here by a cursed object, but your bond with the gods protects you somewhat.
10413:Your prayers work. One of the gravestones shatters into dust, and along with it, the unliving fall to the ground. 
10414:'Welcome, what brings you to our humble abode?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}This village is small, as such, it will not offer recruitment and may have other options limited.
10415:You're in luck, the tavern is open. Visit it.
10416:Visit the food stalls.
10417:'Yeah, nasty bunch of scoundrels are setting up nearby. We're small, and we're worried they may hit us soon. But if you got them first...'
10418:'Welcome, what brings you to our humble abode?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it. {}{}{}{}When you are friends, visit the tavern to recruit people.
10419:Visit the tavern to gamble, drink or recruit once you are friends. 
10420:'Well, now that you mention it, there's an old cemetery not far, and truth be told, we don't have the means to clear it ourselves. So if you go have a look, it'll help us out for sure.'
10421:'There's always trouble about the place. Some boars are roaming nearby and causing a lot of trouble. We'd go deal with it, but since you asked...'
10422:[Witch] Say you only need your sister's aid, and you'll pay the price yourself and promise not to burden her. 
10423:Agree to pay the price for curing curses.
10424:You have no spirit wounds or curses, leave.
10425:'We do seem to have a problem with predators roaming our territory. Troublesome lot, and we'd go deal with them ourselves, but you asked if you could help.'
10426:'Well, now that you mention it, there's an old grave site not too far. We've been hearing strange noises, moaning and groaning -- and not the good type. We fear the unliving may haunt it, and when they smell our flesh, they're sure to come. Get rid of them.'
10427:You approach the area where the pack of boars you were asked to deal with is said to roam.
10428:You know how to handle boars. Try to figure it out.
10429:[Hunter]Track the boars.
10430:[Nature or intellect]Use your mental prowess to figure out what to do. 
10431:[Boar rider]Dominate the boars.
10432:Use your food to lure these animals away from the territory and hope they won't come back.
10433:You get in closer and observe. The boars have some piglets with them, which can make them more aggressive, but may also provide an opportunity.
10434:[Beast master or boar rider]Boars are your specialty. Create enough chaos to make them flee, then try to separate and capture the young.
10435:Some in your group can communicate with boars, so try to make them obey you.
10436:The sow will be very protective of her piglets. Try to make this area seem too risky a place to raise young.
10437:You stalk the boars and can take them out one by one, then make the rest flee.{}{}
10438:Your plan works to perfection. The herd is chased away, and some younglings are caught. Perhaps you'll be able to train one.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and the Slavyans are grateful.{}{}
10439:One of the wounded boars lashes out at you in a dying frenzy.{}{}
10440:You perform a few sneak attacks to harass the herd and create enough trouble that they decide to move on.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and the Slavyans are grateful.{}{} 
10441:You give the food away and lead the animals to another spot. 
10442:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the boars have returned and continue to harass the settlers. They have to deal with them themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10443:You were unconvincing. The beasts stay.
10444:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the boars.{}{}{}{}The folk who asked for your help hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the boars themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10445:The boars bow to your dominance and depart. Perhaps one or two may even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are happy with your work.{}{}
10446:The folk who asked for your help hear of your failure and come to your aid. They kill the boars themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10447:Your plan backfires. The boars panic and run, but they end up trampling some villagers. You do catch some piglets, though.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10448:You approach the area where the pack of bears you were asked to deal with is said to roam.
10449:You get in closer and observe several bears huddled in a cave.
10450:Some of your group can communicate with bears, so try to make them obey you.
10451:Bears respect territory. Try to figure out a way to mark this land for the Slavyans, thus making the bears leave.
10452:You stalk the bears and can take them out one by one, then make the rest flee.{}{}
10453:You wrestle the alpha bear and break its neck with your bare hands. The other bears submit to your dominance. {}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and the Slavyans are grateful.{}{}
10454:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the bears have returned and continue to harass the settlers. They have to deal with them themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10455:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the bears.{}{}{}{}The folk who asked for your help hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the bears themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10456:The bears bow to your dominance and depart. Perhaps one or two may even decide to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are happy with your work.{}{}
10457:The folk who asked for your help hear of your failure and come to your aid. They kill the bears themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10458:You wrestle the bear, but the others do not care and wander off, though you don't notice. Later you learn that, angered by your interruption, the bears lashed out at the villagers.{}{}{}{}The Slavyans are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10459:You set up traps and kill most of the rats, while others scamper away. In one of your traps you discover a cradlepossum - an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. {}{}
10460:The vermin are dead or running away. One of the bodies, you discover, was a cradlepossum - an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings.{}{}
10461:The rats listen to your tune and obediently abandon their nest. You notice that one of them was actually a cradlepossum - an overgrown, twisted, vermin-like creature with a large pouch on its front, known to steal away younglings. Most likely, it was not entranced by the flute but rather decided to flee while it could.{}{}
10462:An armed group of Slavyans stands before you.
10463:Convince them you are friendly.
10464:'You ain't our enemy, but you ain't friends, either. Go to our village if you wanna make friends. Now move away.'
10465:'Fine, fine, here, take our stuff and we'll back away, no need for fightin' and no hard feelings either, eh.'
10466:They are not interested in your words. You get chased away and beaten.
10467:'Well, you do seem like the good sort. We'll leave you be.'{}{}{}{}They walk off and you gain some friendship.
10468:Among the old gravestones that tell the tale of the old days, you find a spot where only a single slab of sandstone lies with some very faint and unreadable markings on it. But something draws your attention towards it.
10469:The placement of the stone and the faded markings, which look to you like some sort of warding signs, suggest that whoever was buried here was an undesirable, but also feared. Was the warding meant to protect whoever lies here, or the other way around? Alas, this is unclear. 
10470:This seems likely to be a burial place for outcasts, criminals, and those who were otherwise unwanted in a community or perhaps too poor to get a proper burial.{}{}{}{}As you get closer, you have a fleeting feeling of unease. Dark magics could be at play here.
10471:This seems likely to be a burial place for outcasts, criminals, and those who were otherwise unwanted in a community or perhaps too poor to get a proper burial.
10472:'Oh, fine, fine, yes, I was a wretched soul, murderous villain I was called, damned to eternity tied to this stone. Can you imagine the boredom?{}{}{}{}Just let me leave, and I will reward you, promise.'
10473:You strengthen the ritual binding the spirit here. It skulks away into the shadows, unable to do anything to stop you. You feel a wave of good energy fall upon you -- an aftereffect of the original spell, you think.
10474:You smash the gravestone to pieces, but the ghost remains bound to this place. Clearly, brute force will not break this curse.{}{}{}{}The ghost skulks away, cursing at you, and you see a glimmer of malice in its dead eyes.{}{}{}{}You feel your spirit fatigued from the effort.
10475:'I guess you could call my troubles your typical ghost conundrum -- er, problem. We... I mean, I am stuck here because some vengeful sod trapped my poor spirit in this place.'
10476:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. It's mostly rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}You do, however, find a faded pentagram and a dead body that is not buried. Among its rotten belongings, you find a map drawn on a piece of leather.
10477:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. It's mostly rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}You do find one large crypt that could still hold some mysteries, but to get in, you'd need to move the large slab of stone.
10478:You open the crypt and stab whatever was inside. It looks like a very dead body, and now it?s, er, deader.
10479:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. It's mostly rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}But you notice a creature burrowing under one of the gravestones.{}{}
10480:You enter an ancient grave site, long forgotten by mankind. Among old, decrepit gravestones, you find a large crypt, crushed by a fallen tree. The opening stands ajar, and cold darkness looms within.
10481:Within the crypt you see a stone coffin. The chamber is dark and covered in dust, decay, and spiderwebs, but you notice a pentagram carved into the floor and a thick chain that holds the coffin secure.{}{}
10482:Some of the symbols used on the pentagram and the chain, which you realise is silver, point towards an unliving fiend being laid to rest here -- most likely a striga.{}{}
10483:Create a protective circle of fire and use the silver chain, then open the coffin to see what lies inside.
10484:Try to figure out how to secure the coffin without using the chain. It is good silver, after all.
10485:Open the coffin and kill whatever lies inside. It must be weak, anyway.
10486:You figure out that the load-bearing columns in this crypt are barely standing, and that with a little effort, you can collapse this place on your way out. That way, whatever lies inside should be killed and you'll have the silver.{}{}{}{}In theory...
10487:You create a ring of fire, hold on to the chain, and open the crypt. Within you see a dried-up striga master, its eyes red with hunger and rage, and the iron and silver chains holding it, broken -- you have no more than a few breaths before it lunges at you!
10488:The striga's eyes turn red, it looms above you, and you feel the presence of greatness and power. You kneel before your superior and allow it to taste your blood as tribute.{}{}{}{}When you regain your willpower, the master has left, and your blood boils with disease.{}{}
10489:Your faith is strong, and you're not easily broken. Attack it!
10490:As soon as you enter the grave site, you feel something is amiss. {}{}{}{}Many of the gravestones are crushed and the earth beneath them has been moved. {}{}{}{}It could be grave robbers, but it could be more...
10491:Black cats and mice are often signs of witchery. Kill it!
10492:This knowledge is rare, but being who you are, you recognise the signs. These forms together suggest that this may be a dola demon. They are usually guardian demons, especially fond of protecting young ones and bringing good fortune to those they choose.{}{}{}{}It is odd to find one here, alone.
10493:You sense the overwhelming power of harmony, twisted and unnatural. Something is very wrong here; the laws of harmony and nature are being broken! The figure sees you and speaks:{}{}{}{}'You, you're living... good... or no? No, bad... they will feed on you! Oh, no!'{}{}
10494:The ritual seems to work as the unliving collapse on the ground and the dola begins to disappear, but her form twists and turns in silent agony!{}{}{}{}You feel a curse upon you!
10495:Bind the demon to your service with magic. This is risky, but it could work.
10496:The ritual fails and the unliving corpses move towards you. The demon who seems to control them cries, but does nothing to stop it. 
10497:'The ground shook and shook, and mummy and daddy and my brothers were shook to death. I cried and cried, and a lady came from where the ground shook. She gave me the dolly and said I can have my family back! Now they are back, and we play forever and a day!'
10498:'The dolly is bad? Making mummy and daddy ill? Okay, then...'{}{}{}{}She hands you the doll. You destroy it and the unliving fall down, their unnatural life leaving them. The father nods at you in thanks.{}{}{}{}The girl bursts out crying uncontrollably.
10499:The father speaks up:{}{}'You harm my little girl... but now we feel... hmm... free from something, able to think again. So have this as thanks. But please, go now, my wife may not see it as I do.'
10500:You leave, but as you do, you hear the dola scream once more, then her voice changes and you see angry wraiths roaming the land.
10501:The cemetery is quiet and mostly empty, but you see an unburied body on the ground, clutching a stash of goods.
10502:Bury the corpse and take its stash.
10503:As you grab the stash, the decaying hand that held it grabs you and digs in deep before falling lifeless again. You feel that a foul force has touched you.
10504:You try to bury the corpse, but you have offended its spirit somehow. You feel its anger reaching from the beyond and cursing you!
10505:You discover some ancient ruins hidden amid fog and shrubbery.
10506:As you approach, you realise too late that these are not scavengers, but bandits waiting to ambush you.{}{}{}{}'We're the generu... genr... eh, kind types. Anyway, we take some of your stuff, we let you leave alive.'{}{}
10507:It looks like these are scavengers - a rugged, scruffy lot, pillaging what they can from the ruins. {}{}{}{}You took the time to scout, so now you're in a better position for a tactical attack.
10508:As harmony and intellect dictate, there must be a peaceful way out. These folks look hungry. Offer them food in exchange for letting you search the ruins as well. [Lose 20 food]
10509:You are sorely beaten and perhaps drop some of your stuff so they won?t chase you.{}{}{}{}'Lucky we ain't evil, else we'd take all your things!'
10510:[Light or Harmony] Call upon your domain to protect you from this dark power. 
10511:[Turmoil or Magic] Call upon your domain to shield you from the darkness.
10512:[Magic user] Do not let this darkness win. Gather your spirit and fight it!
10513:You find a hidden cellar -- or, rather, it finds you as you painfully fall through its ceiling onto a hard floor.{}{}
10514:See if you can recruit anyone. [Max 2 Slavyans can be recruited in one game, with a 200 turn cooldown in between after your first successful, so choose wisely.]
10515:There's a bandit sitting in a corner. Approach them.
10516:A child calls out to you.
10517:A child feels they are old enough to begin a new adventure, if you pay their family, they will join you.
10518:'Welcome to our food stalls. Now food isn't easy to get on our lands, so we will only do a food for food exchange.'
10519:See if you can recruit anyone. [Limited to two, with 200 turn cooldown in between.]
10520:There are unwanted orphans that the Slavyans are willing to let go, but you have to leave goods in exchange - when questioned about selling slaves, they tell you this is not slavery at all, just a fair exchange...
10521:Pay for a child.
10522:You find the place where intruders are supposed to have settled. It is a small but thick grove. {}{}{}{}You do see some signs of humanoid presence.
10523:[Hunter or perception]Track the intruders.
10524:You track the intruders to a small cave. Within you spot some movement, and only in time do you realise they are shadow elves stalking about nervously.{}{}{}{}Luckily for you, there seem to be only a few with weapons at the ready.
10525:Surround the shadow folk and make your presence known.
10526:You are ambushed by shadow elves!
10527:You search the place and finally spot some shadow elves. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
10528:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to tell them they need to leave, as the goblins do not want them here.
10529:[Strength]Try to look intimidating and tell them to beat it!
10530:[Shadow elf]Ask your kin why they linger here, where they are not wanted.
10531:You are badly beaten and the goblins have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.' {}{}
10532:'We were merely visiting places of power where the dark yet dwells. Goblins are naturally resilient to it, so they often settle in these odd dark spots filled with mystical energy.{}{}{}{}We are not here to argue with the little folk. In any case, we only wish to harvest some of the force. We will move on soon.' 
10533:[Magic user or Magic]Ask if you can watch their rituals and perhaps even aid one another.
10534:Agree to allow them to stay and finish their rituals if they promise that no harm will come to the goblins.
10535:Insist that they depart within a day regardless. This is not their land. 
10536:[Goblin]Who are they calling little folk?!
10537:'Yes, you may.'{}{}{}{}You join the shadow elves as they perform their ritual dance of the many shadows. As they move in utter silence, their bodies become one with the dark, and you feel the energy and mystical forces of darkness flowing freely, yet under control.{}{}{}{}The shadows eventually disappear, but you feel their ritual touching you as well.
10538:'We came here with a task, and we will not leave. Begone.'
10539:The shadow elves stop in their tracks and freeze, staring at you. You know most of them are ready to fight, but one speaks:{}{}{}{}'Please, we do not wish to fight. We are merely passing through.'
10540:[Elf]Demand that they leave now. They are a scourge of your kin and they bring darkness into the fold.
10541:Tell them the woodland folk do not want them as neighbours, and ask them to relocate, now!
10542:The shadow elves depart as promised. The goblins are pleased with your resolution and even leave you a gift.
10543:The goblins are pleased with your help, or at least they do not show otherwise, and they offer a small reward.
10544:When you inform the goblins of your failure, they are disappointed in your efforts. 
10545:You kill the shadow elves. {}{}{}{}The goblins are pleased that their troubles are gone. They leave you a reward.
10546:'I meant no offence, apologies. In any case, we only wish to harvest some of the force. We will move on soon.'
10547:[Elf or goblin]Soon for an elf, or soon for normal folk?
10548:'We cannot make such a promise fully, as our taking of the power may interfere with your friends, but it should not do them much harm.'
10549:Let them proceed.
10550:The shadow elves stay and perform their dark rituals. Alas, the goblins are furious, as the spirits in the area are harmed badly and so are some of the shamans!
10551:'Soon.'
10552:'Simply go? Because you ask . . . We will do so, if you allow us to drain a little of your spirit. We won't take much, but we are weakened, so we need to take some.'
10553:'You are small and you are people - it is an accurate description, no? In any case, as I said, we mean no trouble.'
10554:You find the haunted tree and discover some roaming ghosts thrashing about angrily.{}{}{}{}They seem bound to the tree for now, but you feel their energy spilling out from this boundary.
10555:[Magic user]Perform a ritual to destroy these ghosts.
10556:[Forest folk or Nature]You know the forest well. Meditate and give strength to the tree so it may devour these spirits. 
10557:[Shaman or ghost]Speak to the ghosts, and convince them to calm down and find a way to leave here in peace.
10558:[Shaman]Face the ghosts in a battle of spirit and try to send them back to the greyworld safely.
10559:[Perception]Investigate this place further.
10560:[Ghost]Go in alone and speak to your kin.
10561:You form a circle and connect your own spirit with that of the tree. {}{}{}{}The forest can now destroy these ghosts, although it will not be an easy end for the spirits.{}{}{}{}You will need to give some of your own spirit to complete the ritual.{}{}
10562:Continue to aid the tree, and give your spirit health.
10563:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You speak of the danger of misbehaving so close to goblin shamans who can destroy ghosts if they wish to.{}{}{}{}The ghosts explain that a dark object keeps them here and makes them angry. As an awakened ghost, you take the object away and your kin can now leave peacefully.
10564:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You speak of the danger of misbehaving so close to goblin shamans who can destroy ghosts if they wish to.{}{}{}{}But the ghosts are agitated and barely able to speak to you. They are turning into wraiths. They snarl at you and threaten to attack.
10565:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You speak of the danger of misbehaving so close to goblin shamans who can destroy ghosts if they wish to.{}{}{}{}The ghosts beg you to stay with them and show them the right way.
10566:Agree to take on the responsibility. [Lose one ghost]
10567:Do not allow your friend to leave!
10568:Your ritual works and the ghosts are destroyed.{}{}{}{}But when you report back to the goblin folk, they are unhappy with your crude ways, claiming that showing such disrespect towards spirits will earn them much trouble. 
10569:A single ghost survived your purge and seems interested in you, but not aggressive. Approach it. 
10570:The lone spirit is in awe of your power and wants to join you. 
10571:You search the debris and discover several pineconettes still alive. Most scatter away into the woodland, but one seems to want to stay with you.{}{}{}{}Its eyes seem partially afflicted with the odd light -- or is it just your mind playing tricks?
10572:Take the pineconette with you.
10573:The light is unnatural and the demon would surely dread the idea of being infected. Kill it swiftly.
10574:You set up traps and kill most of the pineconettes, which turn into white ash. Others scamper away. {}{}{}{}At first, the elves are distraught by your violence, but when they investigate the remains, they agree that perhaps this was the only way.
10575:The ghosts are triggered and swarm you without reason. The goblins have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
10576:Your friend is depressed by your decision and the ghosts become agitated again.
10577:The ghosts calm down and explain that a dark object keeps them here and makes them angry. You take the object away and now your kin are able to leave peacefully.{}{}{}{}Your domain is satisfied with the peaceful resolution.{}{}{}{}The goblins thank you and leave a reward.
10578:The ghosts calm down and explain that a dark object keeps them here and makes them angry. You take the object away and now your kin are able to leave peacefully.{}{}{}{}The goblins thank you and leave a reward.
10579:You get in closer and notice the pineconettes behaving oddly. Where you thought they were simply being destructive, you now see they were chasing one of their own and are tearing it apart!
10580:[Hunter]Try to sneak in and set up traps to get rid of the sick forest demons.
10581:[Forest folk]Use your affinity to the forest to call out to the demons. Ask the forest to aid you!
10582:Attack the pineconettes!
10583:The goblins are pleased and leave some gifts for your efforts.
10584:One of the ghosts lingers. Approach it.
10585:The ghosts beat you badly and force you to flee. The goblins have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
10586:The ghosts are destroyed, but the goblins seem less than happy, as they say it is only a temporary fix when it comes to ghosts.{}{}{}{}Still, they recognise your efforts and you gain some favour.
10587:The elves leave some gifts for your efforts.
10588:You destroy the crazed pineconettes and they turn into white ash.{}{}{}{}At first, the elves are distraught by your violence, but when they see the remains, they agree that perhaps this was the only way.{}{}
10589:You see the eyes of the raging pineconettes burn with a bright light, a light that is also consuming their fragile bodies, and yet they still rage on, chasing their brethren who seem normal and unwilling to accept this odd light. {}{}
10590:Keep calling the forest.
10591:Your ritual works and the ghosts are destroyed.{}{}{}{}But when you report back to the goblin folk, they are unhappy with your crude ways, claiming that showing such disrespect towards spirits will earn them much trouble.{}{}{}{}Still, they recognise your efforts and you gain some small favour.
10592:When you call the forest, it responds and the strange pineconettes finally burn through entirely, leaving some grateful survivors behind.{}{}{}{}When you ask them what happened here, they do not know, only that the light tried to take them.{}{}
10593:Help them rejoin the elves in the village.
10594:You approach the area where the rogue forest guardians are said to dwell.{}{}{}{}You see a dark, enclosed grove and you sense many eyes watching you.
10595:[Wood folk]Approach with caution and try to speak to the forest guardians.
10596:[Goblin Shaman]Ask the forest spirits to tell you what is amiss here.
10597:[Harmony]Evoke the power of Harmony to appease this old spirit's anger.
10598:[Nature]Call out to your domain to show the forest demons that you are on their side.
10599:Offer your own spirit energy to appease this old creature and have it leave the goblins alone. [Take spirit damage]
10600:There is certainly a forest spirit here. It speaks up:{}{}{}{}'I claim this patch of woodland, so you best begone!'
10601:[Forest demon]Call out to your brethren and remind them that goblins are forest friends too and should not be attacked without reason!
10602:Implore the forest guardians to listen to reason. Surely the goblins did nothing to deserve being attacked.
10603:[Magic user]This forest guardian seems somewhat unhinged. Enter the spirit realm and fight them there so you can bring some sense into the old wood.
10604:[Orc]These forest demons are out of control. Surround them, plant pyres in the right places, and burn them! It will be a challenge to do it fast enough, but you know how to burn forests.
10605:The spirits tell you that the vily are tainted by an odd, burning light. This makes them more aggressive and unstable.{}{}{}{}The spirits offer to trap the vily's souls in the spirit realm, but this will mean a slow and painful death for them.
10606:Yes, do it. A rogue guardian is dangerous for the forest and the spirits that dwell here.
10607:Give up. Inform the goblins of this. 
10608:[Harmony]Invoke the power of Harmony to appease this old spirit's anger.
10609:The forest guardians listen and admit they were being overly protective. They thank you for reminding them.{}{}{}{}The goblins are also grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
10610:The vily fight back and lash out at you as their souls are dragged into the trap. {}{}
10611:You face the vily in the spirit realm and find their auras tainted by burning light, which you help to clear. The forest guardians thank you and promise not to bother the goblins anymore.{}{}{}{}The goblins are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
10612:The goblins are fascinated by what went on here, although they are concerned about the brutality of your act and its long-term effects on the spirit greyworld in this area.{}{}{}{}Your friendship doesn't grow as much as you hoped, but you still get rewarded.{}{}
10613:You gave your spirit to the forest guardians and they move away.
10614:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you learn that the vily returned to their spot and continued to harass the settlers. They have to deal with the vily themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
10615:The goblins are grateful for your sacrifice and help. {}{}
10616:You destroy the vily. But when you report back to the goblins, they are not as happy as you expected, saying that forest guardians are best kept appeased. Still, you did your job and your friendship grows a little.{}{}
10617:You are defeated. The goblins hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the forest guardians themselves and are angry at having to do so.
10618:You are unconvincing and the vily stay put, resolved to fight the goblins.
10619:You fail, and the goblins hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the forest guardians themselves and are angry at having to do so.
10620:The goblins are not pleased that you're passing on the work.{}{}{}{}They thank you for trying, but you feel their words are less than sincere.
10621:'Goblins are flesh folk, you serve them too, so you will pay for all the forest pain!'{}{}{}{}The forest guardians attack you, and the goblins have to come to your rescue. {}{}
10622:The vily listen to your words and nod in agreement. They promise not to cause trouble if the goblins stay true to the forests.{}{}{}{}The goblins are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
10623:Your plan works and the forest guardians are too slow to escape the flames. {}{}{}{}The goblins, however, are horrified at the destruction of their land. They whisper something about orcish brutes doing their typical thing. Your friendship does not grow.
10624:The forest spirits look ashamed of themselves and do not speak, just leave quietly.{}{}{}{}The goblins are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
10625:You find the small graveyard where the goblins warned of spirit trouble.
10626:[Magic user or Magic]Some dark magic may be at work here. Investigate.
10627:You have folk who know about the unliving. Take a closer look.
10628:[Nature or Light]Through Nature and Light, cleanse this place of the foul force that violates the laws of your gods.
10629:[Zerca]These wraiths are bound here, and you happen to know by what ritual. All you need to do is bury some silver in the ground and sacrifice one pet, and the wraiths will bother the goblins no more. Do it.
10630:[Goblin shaman]Enter the greyworld and face the wraiths there so you can release them from this suffering.
10631:[Goblin or spirit]Wraiths are but lost souls, attached to an emotion, place, or person. Seek whatever might be keeping them bound here.
10632:You spot several wraiths walking in circles around a gravestone.
10633:[Wraith]Ask them to move along or leave the villagers be.
10634:[Magic user]Perform a ritual that will keep the unliving trapped here. This is dark magic and may cost you something, but it should work.
10635:You got them by surprise, attack!
10636:A stench of dark magic hits your senses, and you discover that a cursed figurine atop one of the gravestones was causing the souls of the dead to linger and twist into wraiths. {}{}{}{}It is easy to destroy but may wound your spirit and most likely will destroy the wraiths in a painful way.
10637:[Nature or Light]Through nature and light, cleanse this place of the foul force that violates the laws of your gods.
10638:Turns out the wraiths were called here by a cursed object, but your words are able to snap them out of the trance. They are grateful and do as you wish. {}{}{}{}The goblins are impressed with your work and thank you.{}{}
10639:The wraiths are destroyed in a shattering flash of pain and anguish. {}{}{}{}The goblin spirit talkers heard the souls' outcries and were saddened by such a brutal resolution. Your friendship suffers.{}{}
10640:You bury the precious metal and sacrifice the life essence of one pet. The wraiths should now stay trapped in the spirit greyworld.
10641:You are about to report your success when you realise that perhaps your knowledge was not entirely accurate. The wraiths remain, and some mischievous demons were attracted by the free metal and now keep stealing from the goblins.{}{}{}{}They are eventually beaten by the spirit talkers without your help, and your friendship suffers for it.
10642:The goblins are pleasantly surprised, though a bit baffled by your methods. They ask you to stay, tell them more, and share their herbs and shrooms so you may both enjoy the wisdom of spirit visions.{}{}
10643:You destroy the wraiths, and the goblins thank you for your efforts, but they murmur something about your lack of knowledge and finesse -- and the wraiths' eventual return.{}{}{}{}Your friendship grows a bit.{}{}
10644:The goblins hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the wraiths themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. 
10645:Your efforts fail and the wraiths turn their attention to you.
10646:You bind the wraiths to this gravesite, and unless someone purposefully breaks your work, they will remain here. {}{}{}{}The goblins like your resolution. You've bought them some time so they can deal with this problem properly later. {}{}
10647:Turns out the wraiths were called here by a cursed object. Your bond with the gods protects you somewhat, but when you try to release your kin, they are torn apart in great pain.{}{}{}{}The goblins are saddened by the turn of events, but seeing as you are spirit, they appreciate your efforts. 
10648:Your prayers work. One of the gravestones shatters into dust, and along with it the wraiths are released from their binding and disappear peacefully.{}{}{}{}The goblins are impressed with your work and praise 'those hummie gods.'
10649:Your spirit proves strong enough to guide the angry souls towards balance and eventual peace.{}{}{}{}The goblins appreciate your professional intervention and leave a payment.{}{}
10650:You find the object -- a gravestone -- and you talk to the wraiths. They tell you this is the resting place of their oppressor. You agree to defile the gravestone, and this appeases the wraiths enough for them to leave. You also spread salt and throw poppy seeds over your left shoulder three times to make sure a new wraith doesn't rise.{}{}{}{}The goblins are impressed with your work and praise 'those hummie gods.'
10651:'We welcome you, yes, but why do you come?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}This village is small, as such, it will not offer recruitment and may have other options limited.
10652:Say that you just came to rest and visit. Maybe see some healers.
10653:Ask if you can try to befriend some ghosts that they house here.
10654:'You stink bad, you no friends of ours, go away!'{}{}
10655:'Help, eh? Sure, why not. We're small, so we can't do it all. We got ourselves a stray ghost not far from here. Go see if you can deal with it.'
10656:'You come, you rest, you smoke with us. The shamans have good shrooms too, heal many things - sometimes make you sick too, but mostly heal.'
10657:Ask the shamans to heal your spirit if they can.
10658:[Mysticism]A shaman is offering a trip to the greyworld. If you live, you may learn mystical ways.
10659:'Help, eh? Sure, why not. We think some loony forest fairies are taking their tooth fairy job too far. A few good folk gone missing, many lose their teeth at night, uninvited. Please, do go and beat those buggers for us!'
10660:'You want to help for free? Yes, you can do that, why not?'
10661:Ask if they are having any trouble.
10662:You have a lot of good metals on you. Ask if they need some.
10663:You have some stones. Ask if they need some.
10664:'Darkness is part of our world, yes. But too much, not good, no. We are too small to go, but you go. You make the black mist retreat -- not destroy it, mind you! Just make it become less, please.'
10665:'Yes, yes, your spirit is dirty as a whelp's arse, I smell it. Now, if you have curses on you, that cost more, yes. So you pay, I give you drink and smoke and you no complain if you get a little sick, yes?'
10666:[Goblin]Tell him to stop jabbering about the prices and give you the right shrooms, not the tourist stuff. 
10667:[Magic users]Say that you know how to do some of the cleansing, but you require their aid to do it properly.
10668:Agree to pay the price to remove curses. [20 precious gems]
10669:Say that you do not have the payment.
10670:'Gah, I am old, my eyes are cloudy, you git, you wait to say it now, make me look silly. You sit, you eat and be well.{}{}{}{}Your friends, they get good stuff too, but they pay.'
10671:'You give us free goods, you are odd. We try to give you little something too, we not like debts.'
10672:'I do the spirit talk for you, maybe some soul wants to join to you, maybe no. You pay price, you be nice, we be friends still.'
10673:Try to befriend a ghost.
10674:'We do have some, well, intruders. They set up camp not too far and we wish them gone, now.'
10675:'Agreed, you may enter, for now.'
10676:'Leave!'
10677:A ghost takes interest in you and will join you if you give him some of your spirit.
10678:It is wraiths, not mere ghosts, that answer your call, but their price for bondage is some of your blood.
10679:Alas, no ghost wanted to join your ranks this time.
10680:'Ah, why not say so before? I give you the good stuff, no tourist bullshit. You help with the ritual, so you not pay me. Maybe when my spirit is bad, you do the same. Sit, eat, relax.'{}{}
10681:The greyworld is no place for the living, especially not those who are not spirit talkers. Your flesh is torn from your body, your soul twisted and mauled. {}{}{}{}You return changed, angry, and lost. Yet your bond with the divine allows you to persist on your path.
10682:'Ah yes, the hurting of the heart, eh? Dark world make you cry. We goblin, we smoke this, it make us happy again - sometimes too happy. You be no goblin, you may not like, but you pay and I let you try, yes?'
10683:[Goblin or loyalty]Tell him he smokes too much of it already, seeing as he can't spot his own kin anymore. Take the pipe and share it safely with your friends.
10684:You approach the area where the pack of unruly forest fairies you were asked to deal with is said to roam.
10685:You know how to handle forest sprites. Try to figure it out.
10686:[Hunter]Stalk these fairies.
10687:[Leshy]Dominate the fairies and call for obedience!
10688:Try to reason with the fairies. Surely this is not the way of forest demons.
10689:You get in closer and observe. The forest fairies are huddled together, whispering. Beneath them lies a small mound of teeth, many bloodied and crooked.{}{}{}{}You also spot the body of a goblin, their teeth brutally pulled out, their hands and feet bound.
10690:[Forest fairy]Fly up to your folk and tell them they are definitely taking the tooth fairy job too far. 
10691:Speak to them and call upon their duty to the forest and demon lore.
10692:[Magic user]You sense some mystical force here. Perhaps it is why they behave so? Try a cleansing ritual.
10693:[Child]These are tooth fairies for sure! Offer them your baby teeth and ask them to pay, as they should!
10694:You stalk the fairies and observe as they gather around a mound of pulled teeth and a dead, bound goblin body.{}{}{}{}Your observation will also make it easier to kill them off quietly, one by one.{}{}
10695:Kill them off.
10696:The fairies seem agitated and some have an odd, fiery glare in their eyes. But they are very curious about your divine connection and agree to leave this turf in exchange for some god stories. {}{}{}{}When the goblins learn of this, they will surely be happy with your resolution.
10697:Tell them many tales and watch them leave.
10698:Some of the fairies fight back and wound you.{}{}
10699:The goblins are impressed with your quick and quiet resolution. They now deem you as the fairy stalker. You are not sure if this is an honour or a joke, but they seem happy with your work.{}{}
10700:The fairies beat you badly and the goblins have to come and rescue you. They are not impressed, so you do not gain friendship.
10701:You are unconvincing, so the fairies continue their odd behaviour.
10702:Your scheming fails and you are assailed by the fairies.{}{}{}{}The goblins hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the fairies themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
10703:'Bah, you tricky-tongue big folk, you. Stupid laws, stupid rules. We'll be back!'{}{}{}{}The fairies fly away and the goblins are grateful for your help.{}{}
10704:The goblins appreciate your candour, so you gain some friendship despite the failure.
10705:You go to talk sense into them, but instead they speak of the addictive joy of possessing more and more teeth . . . Before you know it, you try to pull some of your friends' teeth out.{}{}{}{}The fairies laugh, and eventually the goblins have to come and deal with this problem themselves. They are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10706:The fairies hear your forest cry and stop in their tracks. Whatever drove them to this craziness has broken, and they bow to your will with apologies. They promise to repair any damage.{}{}{}{}The goblins are pleased with your efforts.{}{}
10707:It turns out there was no mystical force making the fairies misbehave, but you did dispel some power they may have been using to catch their victims.{}{}{}{}'Bah, you tricky-tongue big folk, you. Stupid laws, stupid rules, stupid rituals. We'll be back!'{}{}{}{}The fairies fly away and the goblins are grateful for your help.{}{}
10708:You kill the fairies, and the goblins thank you for dealing with the problem, although they wish you did it more quietly -- angering forest demons is never a good thing. {}{}
10709:The fairies stop in their tracks and stare at you. They confer, then nod in solemn agreement:{}{}{}{}'Fair enough. Not so many kids around these dark days, we like legit teeth more than those. Deal. But it will hurt!'
10710:Aren't they supposed to wait until the teeth fall out and all that?
10711:Proceed with the deal.
10712:Ask if they are tooth fairies or forest fairies.
10713:'Nah, old stuff. Rules change, loopholes happen, supervisors aren't always around . . . all that.'
10714:'Both, clearly. We dabble. We were born of the woodlands, then folk began to settle, new jobs emerged. We kept both, unlike those house demons -- they get all focused and all.'
10715:They take your teeth and fly away happy. The goblins are very grateful for your clever resolution.{}{}
10716:You approach the bat cave that the goblins asked you to clear.
10717:You know how to handle beasts. Take a closer look.
10718:[Hunter]Track the bats.
10719:[Intellect]Use your mental prowess to figure out what to do. 
10720:[Witch]Bats are your minions, dominate them!
10721:[Night demon]Command the bats to obey the call of the night!
10722:Within the cave you spot the bats swarming the tunnels. They seem more agitated than you'd expect, and there is a dead goblin, drained of blood, lying on the ground.
10723:[Animal kin]Observe the bats carefully and try to assess what is causing this behaviour. Perhaps you can help them.
10724:[Nature or Intellect]Seek a divine inspiration to figure out what disturbed these beasts.
10725:[Hunter]Stalk the bats quietly.
10726:[Hunter]Set traps to make killing the bats easier.
10727:You observe the bats and see that some are already dying from the same disease. It seems to be an aggressive strain. You are in a good position to pick them off one by one, but some may bite back and thus you risk contracting the disease yourself.{}{}
10728:Do it -- kill them off one by one.
10729:The bats heed your call and fall in line. You discover that some of them are gravely ill, and this is why the rest fell into a frenzy. Together, you eliminate the weak ones, and the others begin to behave naturally again.{}{}{}{}The goblins are impressed with your efforts.{}{}
10730:As you anticipated, some bats spot you and try to fight back.{}{}
10731:Eventually, you get rid of all the diseased bats.{}{}{}{}The goblins are pleased with your efforts.{}{}
10732:You give the food away and lead the animals to another spot. {}{}{}{}However, these are rabid animals, and not only do they eventually return, but the goblins are not impressed with you allowing the illness to spread on their land.{}{}{}{}Your friendship suffers for it.
10733:The bats are dead and the goblins are happy with your work.{}{}
10734:The bats beat you badly and some of you get sick. The goblins have to come to your rescue and deal with the problem themselves. {}{}{}{}They are not impressed with your 'help.'
10735:You observe the bats but cannot figure out what is wrong with them. Perhaps they are simply touched by darkness.{}{}{}{}Some of you fall ill from the contact.
10736:You figure out the source of the bats' crazed behaviour -- an illness caused by a poisoned spring in the cave.{}{}{}{}You have the right herbs to cleanse the water, and the bats soon return to normal. {}{}{}{}Some of you fall ill as a result, but the goblins are very impressed with your work.{}{}
10737:The bats are clearly taken by some unnatural force, as they ignore your call and attack you, spreading their vile disease. The goblins have to come and aid you.{}{}{}{}They are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
10738:The bats hear your voice and feel the touch of your dark spell. They scatter quickly.{}{}{}{}The goblins are happy with your work and allow you to loot the cave before they go in deeper.{}{}
10739:[Hunter]Set traps to kill the rabid bats quickly. It is the safest way to stop them from spreading.
10740:Give up and report back to the goblins.
10741:The goblins appreciate your candour, so you do not lose any friendship despite the failure.
10742:An armed group of spirit talker greenskins stands before you.{}{}{}{}
10743:Goblins respect the spirit world above all, face them there to show you are a worthy friend.
10744:Inhale some shrooms together.
10745:'You no villain, but no friend of ours either. You go to our tribe, make friends. Time to give us yyour goods or die!'
10746:Give them some of your things.
10747:'Oi, yes, yes, you big, you scary, we leave our stuff, we go. Bye.'
10748:'Oi, you know the spirits well and they seem to favour you. Maybe we be friends after all. For now, we part ways in good faith.'
10749:The spirits did not favour your attempts and the goblins frown at your lack of skill. But they do let you go.
10750:You find the old ruins where the goblins said darkness lingers and quietly grows in strength.{}{}{}{}You can sense the intense stare of chaos and despair seeking to devour you.
10751:[Light or Harmony]Call upon your domain to cleanse this place of the dark entirely. The goblins may want to leave some, but it is your duty to be rid of it all!
10752:[Shadow elf]Become one with the dark mist and redirect it away from this place. This should spread the force and thus stop this supposed growth.
10753:[Magic users or Magic]Perform a ritual of weakening that will not destroy but only lessen the concentration of darkness here.
10754:[Wisdom]Consider your options carefully.
10755:Try attacking the mist.
10756:Come back with more wisdom or those who know of mystical things.
10757:The black mist is a force that feeds on spirit. And yet, if one can resist its attack long enough, this will deplete its power considerably. It is very risky, of course.
10758:Enter the mist and try to resist it by the sheer strength of your mind.
10759:You persevere, and indeed the black mist lessens in intensity and withdraws deeper into the ruins. {}{}{}{}The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here -- you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10760:The black mist follows your lead, so its hold over this piece of land lessens.{}{}{}{}The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here -- you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10761:The ritual works, and indeed the black mist lessens in intensity and withdraws deeper into the ruins. {}{}{}{}The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here - you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10762:A goblin shaman pulls you out of the black mist:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. You try, well done. Now bye.'
10763:The ritual works, and indeed the black mist is destroyed by your divine word.{}{}{}{}The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'What?! We need the dark, we do. Not so much, no. But some, yes. You godly folk, you always do this. Go, go.'{}{}
10764:You charge at the mist and it engulfs you in pure despair. Your feet shake, your jaw tightens, and the nightmares circle you and whisper your darkest thoughts.{}{}{}{}And yet, despite all odds, brute force perseveres. You lash out and the black mist retreats.
10765:The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Certainly not like that! Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here - you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10766: You charge at the mist and it engulfs you in pure despair. Your feet shake, your jaw tightens, and the nightmares circle you and whisper your darkest thoughts.{}{}
10767:Try to get out!
10768:'We welcome you, yes, but why do you come?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}Once you become friends, you will get the chance to recruit.
10769:Ask if they can show you the greyworld, lands of the spirits.
10770:See if you can train your pets here.
10771:'Help, eh? Sure, why not. Some vily demons gone mad on us, attacking our homes for no good reason. Go see what is up with them.'
10772:'You come, you rest, you smoke with us. The shamans have good shrooms too, heal many things -- sometimes make you sick too, but mostly heal.'
10773:'Help, eh? Sure, why not. We normally deal with spirit stuff our own way, but truth be told, we've had real trouble at a graveyard, and we don't have the shamans to send their way soon enough. You go, deal with it, we be friends for sure.'
10774:'You want to help, eh? Why not.'
10775:Ask if there are places of interest around here.
10776:'There is a cave we want to see, but damned bats have become real shits lately. Killed some of our folk, made others ill. Weird stuff. Deal with them lot and we be friends for sure.'
10777:'Gah, I am old, my eyes are cloudy, you git, you wait to say it now, make me look silly. You sit, you eat and be well.{}{}{}{}Your friends, they get good stuff too, but they pay.'{}{}
10778:'You ask a lot, even for friend. This be very dangerous for you. But I say yes if you still want?'{}{}{}{}Several shamans gather in a sweat tent filled with strong herbal aromas and hot steam. You are invited in.
10779:Tell them you have reconsidered and will pay your respects to the ritual from afar.
10780:Go into the sweat tent to join the shamans in the ritual.
10781:'We do have some, well, trouble with our youngsters. They went all wayward on us. Took many hard herbs and shrooms, set up camp, and now they do some strange rituals there. {}{}{}{}We feel the greyworld shaken by this, very bad for spirits. But they do not listen to us, and we cannot spare men to go bring them back. If you go, maybe you do it faster. Better for all that way.'
10782:'Guess so, yes. We busy with many spirit troubles, so we don't go everywhere. But I heard of some ruined dwellings not far, perhaps good stuff for you there? Who knows.'
10783:'Ah yes, the hurting of the heart, eh? Dark world make you cry. We goblin, we smoke this, it make us happy again -- sometimes too happy. You be no goblin, you may not like, but you pay and I let you try, yes?'
10784:You enter the tent, smoke a pipe, and drink goblin wine. The shamans chant and dance. Your mind drifts slowly into a state of bliss. {}{}{}{}Through an odd trinket, a looking glass perched atop the dried hand of a hochlick, you get glimpses of another world - distant, cold, strange. 
10785:[Nature]Call upon nature to honour the bonds between the goblin folk and the forests of old.
10786:[Harmony]The shamans seem erratic and happy about it, so you are not sure how much they will accept your domain. Still, ask Harmony to make this ritual more serene.
10787:[Light]Light does not feel like the natural fit for this ritual, as the greyworld does not suggest a liking of your path. Still, call upon your domain to bless this gathering.
10788:[Intellect]Remain in quiet contemplation to show your respect and understanding of the ancient ways.
10789:[Magic]Call upon the weaves of magic to join the shamans in this spiritual journey.
10790:[Turmoil]Join the shamans in the sweat tent and embrace this new experience with the full exuberance of your domain.
10791:See the beastmaster.
10792:Speak to thye shaman.
10793:The ritual works, and indeed the black mist lessens in intensity and withdraws deeper into the ruins. {}{}{}{}The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here -- you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10794:The air lifts and a goblin shaman approaches you:{}{}{}{}'Heh, I never did think you do it. Certainly not like that! Good, good. We need the dark, we do, but not so much, no. We thank you, here -- you have nice visions from me. Bye.'
10795:You come to the goblin encampment where the young shamans are said to be overdoing the shrooms and going a bit crazy with the ghosts. {}{}{}{}You were asked to bring them back to the spirit talkers tribe. 
10796:[Orc]Beat the shit out of the little greenskins. That ought to teach them discipline!
10797:Beat some sense into them.
10798:'Oi, oi, you come to party with us? If no, then beat it, we discover the truth of the world here, those old gits can leave us be!'{}{}{}{}You see the goblin's eyes are glazed and wide open, his hands twitching, cold sweat covering his green forehead.
10799:Ask them how exactly they are reaching those mysteries of the world.
10800:[Goblin]Tell them they've overdone it with the weeds and the shrooms, and they are tearing a hole in the greyworld with their 'party.'
10801:Say they are ordered to stop whatever they are doing and return home, or else!
10802:'Ah, old farts told you we in trouble, yes? Said we go into greyworld too much, we break rules. Pfft. So what if we do? We find many mysteries here. If you let us stay put, we share some with you.'
10803:Why not? Agree to stay and party. What could go wrong?
10804:No. Tell them they must go back, as the elders said what they do here is hurting the spirits.
10805:'Oh c'mon, we break some rules, sure. But it works, come, join us!'
10806:[Goblin shaman]Shake your shaman stick at them and curse their spirit fathers. Warn the youngsters that you will bring the wrath of the forefathers upon them if they do not go home, now!
10807:[Goblin]Say that the spirit fathers will be very angry at this and they must stop now.
10808:'We got good shrooms, better weeds, and some help from ghost friends. Ever smoked a ghost? Try it!'
10809:[Goblin or ghost]Smoking a ghost?
10810:'Oh, entirely consensual, I swear!'{}{}{}{}The goblin looks a bit more nervous now.
10811:[Goblin or ghost]Demand that they stop this madness immediately or you will bring the wrath of the forefathers upon them.
10812:'Oi, stop with the curses, man! We go, we go, we will not anger the forefather spirits anymore.'{}{}{}{}The youngsters return home and the spirit talker elders are grateful for your help.
10813:You beat the shit out of the young goblins and they beg you to stop:{}{}{}{}'Oi, oi, fine, we go back, we go back!'
10814:Let them go on the condition that they go straight back to their elders and never go astray again!
10815:You slaughter the goblins and a deathly silence fills the air. You can sense the presence of spirits here, and they are not happy.{}{}{}{}When the spirit talkers find out how you resolved this problem, they are furious and tell you to stay away.
10816:The goblins beat you and laugh:{}{}{}{}'Ha, mighty warriors you are, beaten by stoned gobbos, eh? Beat it, go to the old farts, tell 'em we stay and have fun!'{}{}{}{}The spirit talkers hear about your failure and are disappointed that you tried to hurt their youngsters. Your friendship does not grow.
10817:The wayward goblins return to their elders. The spirit talkers are dubious about your methods, but they cannot argue with results.{}{}{}{}Your friendship grows a little and they give you the promised reward. 
10818:It begins as parties do, with food, drink, smoking, and dancing. But with every puff of the oddly ethereal pipes, you feel yourself leaving this plane and entering the spirit world - the greyworld. {}{}{}{}For those who are not trained, this is dangerous, but in your state of bliss, who cares? 
10819:The spirits? Greyworld, so light, so cool, feeling happy, sad, elated, yes. Keep going, just one more puff . . .
10820:For those who do not walk the goblin path, the party ends in much spiritual pain and even physical sickness. {}{}{}{}Even for goblin kin, this was a ghost ride like no other. Only the shamans feel that the benefits outweigh the damage.{}{}
10821:Try to get yourselves together.
10822:The goblin upstarts have moved their camp by the time you wake up from the trance. They left you a gift.{}{}{}{}The spirit talker elders hear of your recklessness and are not happy.
10823:'Oi, stop with the curses, man! We go, we go, we will not anger the forefather spirits anymore.'{}{}{}{}The youngsters pretend to heed your words, but in fact they just move their camp so it won't be found again.{}{}{}{}The spirit talker elders appreciate your efforts, but no friendship was gained here. 
10824:'Fine, fine, we go back.'{}{}{}{}The youngsters return home and the spirit talker elders are grateful for your help. They leave you some gifts as thanks.
10825:You are sent to speak to the three shamans and find them in a circle of luminescent shrooms:{}{}{}{}'You come to talk of the great light, yes? About time too. Your gods are always so slow to pick up the pieces.'
10826:Perhaps, but what have the goblin spirits done about it?
10827:Tell them not to speak ill of the gods you serve!
10828:'Ha ha, true that, true. The spirits are even less inclined to meddle. Happy to stay in the greyworld and watch us destroy this side. But us, we do like our physical shells, yes. So, answers that you seek are hard to find.'
10829:Can they provide any?
10830:'What we will say may not be liked. We have no answers for the past. Spirits only tell us the light was kept under, just as the dark was kept above. Ancient deals, pacts made between beings long gone.'
10831:'No. Those answers we do not hold. But others we have. If light overwhelms, it burns us all. Humans are more change than stability, and you will hurt too. Only elves and perhaps dwarves may find their place in the light. Our world will be burnt.'
10832:Do they have an alternative?
10833:'Us, no. We will not dare speak it. But one does. Go to him. He is alone. He is different. And so he thinks outside of typical bounds. Such thoughts are needed now.{}{}{}{}Here is where the ghosts say he dwells. Beware, for he is not kind, not safe, and not like the divine either, so be nice to him if you want things. Shame Bringer is his name.'
10834:[Orc]That's an orc name and not a good one.
10835:Thank them for the information and leave.
10836:'Yes, he is an outcast of your clans. Like you? No? Perhaps not like you. Unlike others, for sure. Dangerous, full of hate.'
10837:'Ha ha, so sensitive. Don't worry, we like your gods. That Marovit fella, he's one of us, after all. Now, answers that you seek are hard to find.'
10838:The goblin village is full of ash and bones of the fallen. It looks like the lightbringers came here after their power increased. {}{}{}{}The place is dead.
10839:As you come closer, you see a sturdy old tavern built of stone. From the overgrown greenery, unused yard, and broken wooden doors, you assume it is abandoned. 
10840:The rats [R12]lie dead and you are free to take the stash.
10841:The house you were here to search proved empty, but behind it, you discover a cemetery. You see a strange trinket at one of the burial sites.
10842:[Intellect and intelligence] The trinket seems to hold a puzzle. Take a closer look.
10843:[Intelligence] The trinket seems to hold a puzzle. Take a closer look.
10844:You approach the tower of Shame Bringer, the orc who supposedly has a way to beat this growing light. {}{}{}{}The place is unremarkable -- a single stone-built tower. The only oddity is the lack of any visible entrance. 
10845:'My art of necromancy cannot help directly, but I can. I have learnt a truth. Only darkness can defeat this light. Think on it. {}{}{}{}After the Awakening, we had peace in the grey times, where neither the light nor the dark overwhelmed -- a truce. And yes, the black mist's presence will often cause chaos, but it was good.'
10846:'The cosmic tree was neither saved nor burned. It remained in stasis as it was. And this worked -- until the lightbringers came. Someone did not like the new truce. So they released the light.{}{}{}{}I can tell you how to make a heart of darkness. Plant it in the earth-cave and destroy the light-beast for good.'
10847:Agree and go hunt for some mroki. They can be found in the darkness, in volcanic biomes. 
10848:'Pride? Wanting to impress my heartless mother? Or pure survival, maybe. After all, I am master of darkness -- dominance of light or even pure balance are not my friends. If you go my way, I will be stronger, of course.'
10849:'You find a tower, within there are bones and signs of occupancy, but whoever lived here is long gone.'
10850:The fires are warm and the ale is good. The tavern is bustling with life and joy, with loads of shrooms and herbs to smoke. 
10851:See if you can recruit anyone. [Max 2 goblins can be recruited in one game, with a 200 turn cooldown in between after your first successful, so choose wisely.]
10852:Drink, smoke have some shrooms.
10853:Approach a skirmisher.
10854:Approach a beastmaster.
10855:Approach a shaman.
10856:Approach a boar rider.
10857:Approach a worker.
10858:A beastmaster is available but requires a payment.
10859:A goblin child wants to be hired. They are small now, but who knows, they may grow up to become someone great.
10860:One should never try gambling with demons. You were made for trickery, after all. {}{}{}{}You win, but you realise the spirits were watching you and you feel their displeasure directly.
10861:You smoke some stuff and you do not know what went on, but when you leave you find a goblin child with you. Is it yours? Perhaps, or rather, it is now!
10862:As a witch, you've ingested your share of oddities, so the goblin stuff is no challenge.{}{}{}{}You inhale and ride the wave of spirit visions, and impress the locals greatly.{}{}
10863:Goblins are not known for strong heads, and you are Slavyan, after all. So you drink and smoke with them hand in hand, and they are impressed.
10864:That goblin stuff is weird for sure. You do not recall the evening, but you feel its effects painfully?
10865:That goblin stuff is weird for sure. You do not recall the evening, but you feel its effects painfully...
10866:You drank and smoked too much. Apparently you started insulting the locals for being too short and then tried to fit one into your bag to prove it.{}{}{}{}
10867:A shaman is available but requires a payment.
10868:A gatherer and a crafter are available but require a payment.
10869:Pay for a crafter  if you can.
10870:Pay for a gatherer  if you can.
10871:'Oi, you want your pet there trained, do ya? I'll do it, for a fee.'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will only raise it to third rank, no higher and you can only train one pet at a time]
10872:Yes, give a dog to be trained.
10873:Yes, give a goat to be trained.
10874:Yes, give an iron frog to be trained.
10875:Yes, give  one cock to be trained.
10876:'Oi. You travel with spirit companions. For a fee, I go into greyworld and I give your spirits more mojo, eh?'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will only raise it to fourth rank, no higher and you can only train one pet at a time]
10877:Yes, give a ghost to be trained.
10878:Yes, give a wraith to be trained.
10879:'Fee paid, good. Now I go into the greyworld with your spirit.'
10880:The Stingers show you their stash to trade.
10881:'You no friends of ours you pay us extra first.'
10882:'Good trading with you. Now buzz off.'
10883:'You are no friends of ours so you'll have to pay us extra first.'
10884:You hear a dangerous buzz of the Stinger patrol following you!
10885:Bribe the Stingers to show you are a friend.
10886:'You, you good, we don't fight.'
10887:Exchange food and show respect.
10888:You defeat the Stingers.{}{}
10889:The Stingers defeat you and infect you with a toxin before you manage to escape.
10890:The Stingers move away and you even gain some respect from them.
10891:The Stingers do not listen, in fact they use your distracted state to bite you and infect you with a toxin before you manage to escape.
10892:You find a buzzing hub of animal activity. It looks a bit like a large beehive, but then you also spot some underground pairs and various other nests that are organised into one settlement.{}{}{}{}Several bees approach you, and speak:{}{}'You, you no beast. You want fight or you want trade?'{}{}
10893:The lair is buzzing with life, but they try to stay clear of you.{}{}{}{}You can trade or heal toxins, and some spiders may wish to join you for a fee.{}{}{}{}When you're friends, you can recruit some bees, or spider queens, or train your beasts to become stronger, healthier or wiser.
10894:[Beast]Go see about the beast training.
10895:Something it tugging at you. Look down.
10896:Pay with food to have toxins removed by the snakes.
10897:Pay for a rare pet spider [Every 80 turns].
10898:You find a buzzing hub of animal activity. It looks a bit like a large beehive, but then you also spot some underground pairs and various other nests that are organised into one settlement.{}{}{}{}But you are no friends to the stingers, so they attack!{}{}
10899:The stingers' lair is destroyed. Its inhabitants are dead.
10900:The poisonous bite of the stingers proves too strong and you are forced to flee.
10901:A queen bee examines you:{}{}{}{}'Darkness came long ago and changed us. We know how to master our bodies and minds. {}{}{}{}Pay us with meat, lots of it! And we shall train you too, beast friend.'{}{}{}{}
10902:Train the beasts 
10903:A small critter likes you and wants to join, but you need to pay the stingers.
10904:Take it in.
10905:No, go back to town.
10906:The homen - an unliving skeletal procession often foretelling death on a large scale - are seen passing through your village at night.
10907:[Nyia]Bow down to your lady's heralds. Whatever dark fate awaits, it is her will.
10908:[Magic]Call upon your domain to steer the weaves of cruel fate away from your village.
10909:[Zerca]Call upon the aid of the deities to protect you from this dark sign of calamity to come.
10910:[Nature and intellect]Approach this problem calmly.
10911:Take extra care of your children. Huddle together and try to wait out this procession.
10912:Run out and try to attack the homen!
10913:Through nature and intellect, you accept the will of fate. You have seen signs of growing sickness over the last few weeks, and you assume this is what the heralds foretold. {}{}{}{}You stand ready to deal with this now.
10914:Try to help the sick.
10915:You huddle together for safety, but the fear of the homen drains your resolve. {}{}{}{}Great sickness spreads through the land and takes many lives, especially those of the young.
10916:Accept the will of the gods and do your best to heal the sick.
10917:You huddle together for safety, but the fear of the homen drains your resolve. {}{}{}{}Great sickness spreads through the land over the coming weeks, and many of your own fall ill, although you think you did not get the worst of it. Some of your food supplies also go bad.
10918:You huddle together for safety, but the fear of the homen drains your resolve. {}{}{}{}Great sickness spreads through the land over the coming weeks, and many of your own fall ill.
10919:Altering the weaves of fate is never a safe endeavour, but your gods listen, and you feel the reach of the homen lessen. {}{}{}{}You hear that many villages in your area were struck down with fatal sickness, and you wonder if your own safety made it worse for them.
10920:Give thanks and get back to work.
10921:You ask for the protection of the gods or aid in this dark hour of calamity. Your prayer is answered, and you feel strengthened. {}{}{}{}The homen are heralds of death, thus the gods will not change fate, but you feel that yours could have been much worse.
10922:The homen are heralds of the gods, and their grim procession cannot be swayed easily. Fate will turn its wheel despite your best efforts. {}{}{}{}Dreadful sickness spreads throughout the land over the next few days, killing hundreds. 
10923:The homen pass in grim silence, but as they see you bow down, they acknowledge the kinship with a solemn nod. {}{}
10924:Stay silent in respect.
10925:The homen move on and show you the way to a great battlefield not far away, where many folks were recently slain. 
10926:Give burial rites and gather what you can before returning to your village.
10927:The homen move on and, within days, you hear of a great disease wreaking havoc across the land. {}{}{}{}Some of you also fall ill, but you know you were protected from the worst by Nyia.
10928:Give thanks.
10929:Your efforts pay off, and although some folk are still ill, you know it could have gone much worse.
10930:Continue helping till the danger passes.
10931:The homen are but a message from the gods, a projection of your own fears. {}{}{}{}You strike at them, and with every blow you only feel the dread more. 
10932:Get back to the village and hope for the best.
10933:You hear rumours of bandits attacking folk close to your village. They may come here next. 
10934:A preemptive strike is best. Go seek them out.
10935:[Perception]Send out scouts.
10936:Try to be as ready as you can. Double the watch and stay alert.
10937:It is best to try to keep the peace and let cool minds prevail. Collect some goods from your village and offer them to the bandits in the hope that they will go away. [Lose 30% of goods]
10938:You track the bandits, but they are lying in wait for you and shower you with arrows as you approach. 
10939:The scouts report that the bandits are set up near the village and are getting ready to attack.
10940:Try to ambush them first. Attack!
10941:Surround the camp and try to intimidate the bandits into leaving.
10942:Now that you know the exact number and time of the attack, go back to the village and stay ready and armed. Perhaps the bandits will leave when they see that you're prepared.
10943:You lock down the village and guard it well enough that the bandits move on. You had to use more resources than usual during this time, but you're all safe.
10944:You seek out the bandits and offer them the payment. Luckily for you, they agree that bloodshed is more risky than free goods. They take the loot and leave you be.
10945:You seek out the bandits and offer the bribe. They take it, but then they laugh in your faces and say they will now take all!
10946:Stand firm and try to change their mind.
10947:Just as you suspected, the bandits arrive within a few days, ready for a fight!{}{}
10948:Defend the village. 
10949:[Harmony]Perhaps harmony is your way, or your looks make your tongue sweeter. Either way, the bandits seem willing to listen. Parley with them.
10950:You beat the bandits and send them packing. This should keep them at bay for a time.
10951:Take what they carried and get rid of the bodies.
10952:'Fine, fine, we're both, eh, formidable sorts, so let's just part ways, gentlemanly like. We'll even throw in a few bits  to keep the peace, yeah?'{}{}{}{}They back away.
10953:'Bah-ha-ha! You folk sure are funny, offering free goods like that. Tell ya what, you give me half of your village?s goods, and we'll go. Otherwise let's get the beating started.'
10954:Agree. [Lose 50% goods]
10955:'Ah, quit your jabbering. Fine, we'll take your shit and go, seems easier than getting our blades wet. You best watch out offering free stuff, though. If word spreads, you'll get yourself some traffic here...'
10956:Leave the stuff and go.
10957:Just as you suspected, the bandits arrive within a few days, armed and ready to fight. They are not discouraged by your fortifications.{}{}
10958:[Harmony or attractive]Perhaps harmony is your way, or your looks make your tongue sweeter. Either way, the bandits seem willing to listen. Parley with them.
10959:The bandits beat you badly and take what they can carry when they leave, including a child if they found one!
10960:Stay down and let them leave.
10961:Terrible winds rise above your village. You could swear you hear screams and wailing from the skies.
10962:[Wisdom]Figure out what unnatural force hides in the winds.
10963:[Vily or viatroviec]You know full well this storm is unnatural, and you do not sense your own kin at work here. 
10964:Hide and try to wait out this strange storm.
10965:Stand firm and await whatever calamity comes your way.
10966:Typically, you would expect vily to ride the storms, but these winds and sounds seem more attached to grieving souls. {}{}{}{}Lataviec is the common name for wandering spirits that died violently and were lost in the winds, forever searching for revenge, unable to take root in any one place.{}{}
10967:[Domain]If it is the storm or wind itself that traps the souls, in the name of light and nature, ask the gods for a lightning strike to clear these foul skies.
10968:[Magic user]Since this storm is unnatural, perform a ritual to try to ward from it.
10969:Brace yourself for the physical manifestation of these souls.
10970:Leave food offerings for the spirits in the hope that they go away. [Lose 50% food]
10971:You feel an overwhelming drain upon your spirit, the weight of despair and loss, darkness eternal, unquenchable...{}{}{}{}You weather the strange storm indoors, but it ravages through the village, leaving many cuts and bruises and some lost resources.
10972:Thank the skies it is over.
10973:The gods answer, and a thunderstorm ensues. Whatever creatures resided within the unnatural clouds are now burned by righteous lightning. {}{}{}{}But the wrath of the skies sees no boundaries, and you too are struck by the raging lightning.
10974:The gods answer, and a thunderstorm ensues. Whatever creatures resided within the unnatural clouds are now burned by righteous lightning. 
10975:Before long, faces and bodies form in the wind, and a pack of wraiths descends. 
10976:[Wraith]Compel your kin to leave you be. Your own sorrow is enough, and they need to find their own.
10977:[Goblin shaman]Wraiths you can deal with. Rustle up a ritual to capture these wayward souls and hopefully free them.
10978:One of your children was attracted to the food laid out for the spirits. Alas, the deranged souls sought sustenance from the youth as they spirited it away into the skies.
10979:Curse the skies.
10980:Wind spirits swarm your village. Be it your good offering or pure chance, instead of fear and despair, the spirits bring joy and merriment.{}{}{}{}Invigorated by the blessings, lovemaking and laughter take over the village for many, many hours. {}{}{}{}Fruits of the festivities bloom many months later.{}{}
10981:Thank the skies.
10982:The lataviec appreciate your gift. The food is spirited away and the storm ceases, leaving you feeling invigorated. 
10983:The wraiths lie defeated and the skies become clear once more. You spirits are lifted.
10984:You ward off these unfortunate souls and the winds carry them onwards. 
10985:Whatever tormented souls inhabit these storm clouds, their power is overwhelming. They move away from your village, but they leave a heavy strain upon your soul.
10986:The fellow wraiths listen and ascend back into the winds to seek out another fate.
10987:You've heard of these wind ghosts: lataviec is the common name for wandering spirits that died violently and were lost in the winds, forever searching for revenge, unable to take root in any one place.{}{}{}{}As with any tormented soul, bribery or magic may be the way to go.{}{}
10988:[Light or Nature]If it is the storm or wind itself that traps the souls, in the name of light and nature, ask the gods for a lightning strike to clear these foul skies.
10989:Since this storm is unnatural, perform a ritual to try to ward from it.
10990:Your ritual works, and the souls are unbound from their eternal wandering. Some may even stay with you.
10991:You are woken up by a terrible racket coming from your chicken coop.{}{}
10992:Shut yourselves away in the houses and try to wait it out -- whatever 'it' is. 
10993:For days the village is plagued with mishaps and trickery. Broken pottery, sour milk from the cows, rotten eggs from the chickens, fights over nonsense, and so on. You feel mentally drained from it and an illness spreads through the village like wildfire.{}{}{}{}You are not sure if whatever ailed you is gone, but it seems to have lessened its grip for now.{}{}
10994:Get back to village life.
10995:You check the chicken coop, but you find only wet tracks leading into one of the houses. Inside, behind the stove, you find an odd-looking chicken. On closer inspection, it is more like a shrunken old woman with chicken feet, claws, and a twisted, bird-like face. She sits by what looks like a makeshift loom, weaving out of thin air. {}{}
10996:[Wisdom or zerca]Consider the origin of this creature.
10997:Offer her some food as payment. Spirits often go for that.
10998:Just wait her out and hope for the best.
10999:Warding rituals done in haste are never easy or cheap - you must drain some of your own folks' spirit to achieve it. But you ward the village against the influence of the kikimora and for now, at least, it goes away. {}{}{}{}You are left with the creature's handiwork. 
11000:Good. Get back to village life.
11001:You know this to be a kikimora, an odd type of twisted homestead spirit that literally weaves bad luck. {}{}{}{}It is really hard to get rid of a kikimora, as she has no physical form to fight, and she refuses to speak to anyone. Bribery or magic may be the only ways, other than hoping for the best.{}{}
11002:[Leshy]Scorn the kikimora, for she was once a creature of your forest. Some even call her your like although that part is best left unmentioned. Tell her to get back to the woodland.
11003:[Mysticism]Perform a ritual to ward your village from the kikimora and hope it will make her leave peacefully.
11004:[Intellect]Figure out a way to bribe her to leave.
11005:Offer up some food as payment.
11006:The kikimora frowns and mumbles under her breath, but she bows down and leaves, whispering only 'You'll regret this, old man, you will...'{}{}	{}{}The weave she leaves behind proves to be a decent robe.
11007:Wave goodbye and hope you don't run into her in the forest.
11008:For days the village is plagued with mishaps and trickery. Broken pottery, sour milk from the cows, rotten eggs from the chickens, fights over nonsense, and so on. You feel mentally drained from it.{}{}{}{}But eventually, the spirit takes your food and goes away, even leaving a robe it weaved from seemingly invisible thread. {}{}
11009:For days the village is plagued with mishaps and trickery. Broken pottery, sour milk from the cows, rotten eggs from the chickens, fights over nonsense, and so on. You feel mentally drained from it.{}{}{}{}But eventually, whatever plagued your village is gone, and in a twist of good fortune, your crops improve and your spirits lift.{}{}
11010:Your efforts fail. For days the village is plagued with mishaps and trickery. Broken pottery, sour milk from the cows, rotten eggs from the chickens, fights over nonsense, and so on. You feel mentally drained from it and an illness spreads through the village like wildfire.{}{}
11011:You notice this kikimora likes flattery and is very proud of her weaving. You shower her with compliments at every step, and she not only leaves you be but gifts you her finished product. 
11012:After some heavy rain, you discover a nest of vipers has slithered its way into your cellar. {}{}{}{}These white snakes seem very aggressive and they're breeding fast. 
11013:[Hunter]Scout their nest properly.
11014:[Druid or beastmaster]Try mesmerising the snakes to lead them away from your homes.
11015:Leave them be and hope they slither away as fast as they came.
11016:You track the snakes to their source and see they are swarming over a creature they captured, feeding on it and gaining an unnatural vigour and malice.
11017:Use your good position to attack!
11018:[Hunter]Set a trap to get rid of the vipers safely.
11019:You exterminate the snakes and within the nest, you find a dying demon, a cmuch. The snakes were clearly feeding on it and gaining unnatural prowess. 
11020:Try to help it and get rid of the snakes.
11021:The snakes prove themselves sneaky and conniving, slithering away into hidey-holes and making your lives miserable for a time. {}{}{}{}Many people suffer toxic bites, and some livestock too. Then, as fast as the snakes came, they disappear. 
11022:You try your usual tricks, but these snakes seem unnaturally driven to malice. You get bitten and are forced to back off, although you now know exactly where the nest is and how best to strike at it.
11023:You hear a scream coming from the banya. {}{}{}{}When you run into the bathhouse, you see a midget old man with an oversized head, wet streaky hair, and elongated arms. He seems busy cleaning the place. {}{}
11024:[Wisdom]Take a closer look to determine what creature this may be.
11025:[Skshack]Go in and say hi to your house demon friend.
11026:Try to speak to this stranger. Demand to know what he is doing here.
11027:Chase him away!
11028:It is clearly a bannik, a house demon of sorts, particularly fond of bathhouses.{}{}{}{}If you allow it to stay, you will have to leave it water for bathing every third time the baths are used, and never disturb it. Otherwise the bannik may get angry and drown someone.{}{}{}{}In exchange, it will keep your bathhouse clean and safe, and may even foretell the future.
11029:Allow the bannik to stay and stick to its rules. 
11030:The creature either cannot or will not speak to you. Instead it just goes about making a bath. It looks at you annoyed as it is about to get into the tub.
11031:It is likely some sort of demon, but it does not look deadly -- at least, not yet. Best leave it be, and maybe it will go away after it bathes.
11032:You attack the creature and kill its physical form with no trouble. However, the bathwater turns red and remains so for weeks, even with fresh water.{}{}{}{}This causes a spread of illness in your village.
11033:You allow the creature to remain and try to keep out of its way when it occupies the baths. {}{}{}{}In return, you find the bathhouse always clean, fresh, and filled with vitality. {}{}{}{}Some folk become healthier, some have their future foretold, and there's even a chance that other good demons are attracted here.
11034:Thank the demon and get back to village life. 
11035:You allow the creature to remain and try to give it food, as you would with other house demons. {}{}{}{}Alas, when you disturb its bath one time, it gets vicious and almost drowns you. {}{}{}{}It leaves, but for weeks afterwards the bathhouse is cursed with ill fortune.
11036:You chase the creature away, but the very next evening, a pack of utopiec assails your village from within the bathhouse!
11037:You chase the creature away, but for weeks afterwards, the bathhouse is a place of mishaps and ill fortune. The water keeps turning dirty, the floors are slippery, the herbs turn stinky, the roof leaks, and the steam burns.{}{}{}{}Eventually it goes back to normal, but you feel discouraged by the bad luck.
11038:You know this to be a bannik, a house demon of sorts, particularly fond of bathhouses.{}{}{}{}It recognises your kinship and waits to see if you will let it stay. After all, this is your turf. {}{}{}{}If you allow it to stay, you will have to leave it water for bathing every third time the baths are used, and never disturb it. Otherwise the bannik may get angry and drown someone.{}{}{}{}In exchange, it will keep your bathhouse clean and safe, and may even foretell the future.{}{}
11039:Ask it politely to leave but wish it well. 
11040:You allow the bannik to remain and try to keep out of its way when it occupies the baths. {}{}{}{}In return, you find the bathhouse always clean, fresh, and filled with vitality. {}{}{}{}Some folk become healthier, some have their future foretold, and there's even a chance that other good demons are attracted here.
11041:You allow the bannik to remain and try to keep out of its way when it occupies the baths. {}{}{}{}In return, you find the bathhouse always clean, fresh, and filled with vitality. {}{}{}{}Alas, a child accidentally disturbs the demon while it is bathing, and the bannik nearly drowns it in anger. {}{}{}{}The creature leaves, but the bathhouse spreads a nasty sickness for weeks.
11042:Get back to village life. 
11043:A sudden scream has you running to the barn, where you find a large black, shaggy cat with shiny eyes. It barks when it sees you.{}{}
11044:[Wisdom or zerca]Examine the creature carefully.
11045:[Skshack]Greet a fellow house demon. 
11046:Set your dogs on this thing to chase it away!
11047:Give it milk and meat to eat.
11048:The owinnik seems pleased with your efforts. {}{}{}{}Your crops are kept clean and safe, thus increasing yield. And your gatherers feel strengthened too.
11049:Great. Get back to village life.
11050:The creature seems a bit miffed and it certainly lets you feel it. {}{}{}{}But it also liked your polite manner, so apart from having to jump through a few hoops to make it feel special, which left you feeling a bit humiliated, your village is safe.{}{}
11051:The creature shrieks and runs away, dropping some of its stash and hastily throwing a blessing your way, just to make sure you keep the dogs away.
11052:You attack it, but you feel a strain on your spirit. Worse yet, the creature turns into a swarm of rats that attack you.
11053:You kill it, and apart from feeling a heavy strain on your spirit, nothing else happens.
11054:The demon seems offended at your offering, huffing and puffing and barking angrily. {}{}{}{}Most of your food supplies become rotten over the next few days, and you lose some supplies to a fire.
11055:Rescue what you can and get back to village life.
11056:This is an owinnik, an odd house demon that cares for the homestead but is extremely critical of the farmer. {}{}{}{}While it can protect you from fires and keep your crops healthy and safe in storage, it can also do the opposite if not shown respect.{}{}{}{}Gift it with grain if you can, or find another way to show your appreciation.
11057:Give it grain.
11058:You do not have enough grain to give. Give it other food.
11059:[Magic user]It is a demon. Offer it your spirit as a sign of respect and a pact.
11060:Ask it politely to leave, as you have no means to honour its work. 
11061:The fellow demon bows to you and asks for permission to join your homestead. {}{}{}{}It is an owinnik, a very particular creature that usually only accepts grain as payment, although you could try to show respect in other ways. They're very full of themselves.
11062:You do not have enough grain and you know any other food will likely offend it, so politely decline its request to join your homestead.
11063:The owinnik seems somewhat pleased with your efforts. {}{}{}{}Your crops are kept clean and safe, thus increasing yield. And your gatherers feel strengthened too.
11064:The demon seems offended at your ignorance, huffing and puffing and barking angrily. {}{}{}{}Most of your food supplies become rotten over the next few days, and many folk fall ill.
11065:The demon sniffs your offering and decides to accept it. It leaves you with a blessing.
11066:An old woman comes to your gates at night asking for shelter.
11067:[Witch]Greet the sister but warn her that you will not abide any dark deeds here.
11068:[Wisdom]She carries herself with much confidence for a lone traveller. Examine her closer.
11069:[Magic user]You sense weaves of magic around her. Take a closer look.
11070:[Baba Yaga]Warn your demon sister that you will not tolerate her vengeful ways here. 
11071:Invite her in.
11072:A lone woman at night? No. Ask her to leave.
11073:You allow the woman to stay the night, and when you wake, you find a swarm of rats where you left her. {}{}{}{}You find some of your children spirited away by the rat witch and her minions!
11074:Attack the rats before more children are taken!
11075:Let the rats leave. Perhaps you can try to track down the children.
11076:You allow the woman to stay the night, and when you wake, she is gone. But she leaves her blessings and even a small gift for your hospitality.
11077:You kill the remaining rats, so at least no more children are lost.
11078:Send out scouts to try to spot the rat witch.
11079:You fail to defeat the vermin, and if you have any more children, some of them are taken by the running rats. {}{}{}{}The rodents also leave you with disease.
11080:Her body may look old and crooked, but her eyes are vital and strong and her step sprightly. {}{}{}{}Rabbit foot at the belt, the smell of herbs, fingertips tainted from brewing potions. But also a dark streak, an odd complexion, a wild smile. She is most likely a witch, but there's a chance she may be a baba yaga, a dangerous demon.{}{}
11081:Challenge her in a battle of the spirit.
11082:Allow her in but stay vigilant for trickery.
11083:Ward the village and tell her to stay away.
11084:You chase the hag away, but for weeks afterwards, your village is infested with vermin. Disease follows too. 
11085:Get rid of the rats and stay strong.
11086:The hag shrieks in pain as you defeat her spirit. The body withers away into a shrivelled old corpse.
11087:The old hag lies dead; her body shrivels away into an old corpse.
11088:The baba yaga laughs maniacally at your efforts. {}{}{}{}If you have children, some go missing. If you have cats, they follow the hag. You all feel the burden of messing with a baba yaga.
11089:'Sister! Ha. Good fortune, then, for where I normally go I have me a good chance of getting whipped, burned, or chased away. {}{}{}{}No dark trickery from me, dearie. Just rest and peace. We could trade, though?'
11090:Propose a duel of the spirit, one witch against another.
11091:Wish her a good night and go to sleep.
11092:She cocks her head at you and laughs, then cries, then just stares for a time before speaking:{}{}{}{}'Tamed, tamed you are. You sorrow taken? Or hiding only? I wonder. {}{}{}{}A deal. You let me stay and you will have your way.'
11093:Allow her to stay.
11094:Never trust one of your own. Attack!
11095:'Good trading with ya. Now I'm off to sleep. Thank you again for the kindness, sister.'
11096:'Ha, good you are, my sister. I'm obviously getting rusty. Here, a gift for the winner. Now I shall sleep.'
11097:'Well, you did your best, sis. Many lessons to be learnt still. Now I shall sleep.'
11098:The baba yaga stays and seems content to keep to her deal, but upon seeing your child, she goes mad with wild sorrow and kills it in fury before fleeing.
11099:Bury the child.
11100:Your village is besieged by a group of angry ruffians. They carry torches and seem intent on destroying your homes.
11101:Try talking to them. Beseech them in the name of the gods to stop.
11102:You kill the attackers and discover on their bodies signs of freshly healed illnesses, scars, old boils, and medicines taken for many weeks. {}{}{}{}You realise they must have been struck by the deadly sickness when the homen came and you shielded yourselves. 
11103:Give them a burial and get back to work.
11104:Throw the bodies out and get back to work.
11105:'You, you so-called god-fearing folk! You scum were too cowardly to accept the will of the gods and so WE paid!{}{}{}{}All our children dead in days, our elderly and weak too. This is all who survived, and our days are numbered.'{}{}{}{}They take your food supplies, they throw the torches, but you feel their vengeful spirit weaken as they see the futility of their fate and depart.
11106:Keep away in case they become violent again. Then try to save as much as you can. 
11107:'The gods, yes, they do seem to favour you. After all, they listened to your will and let us die in your stead when the homen came. {}{}{}{}All our children, our elderly and the weak, all dead while you stayed safe.'{}{}
11108:[Healer]Offer to help those who survived.
11109:Give them food to help. [Lose 20% food]
11110:Tell them it was the will of the gods and only the strongest survive.
11111:Say that you are sorry, and offer them a place among you if they choose to accept.
11112:It is not the way of harmony to bask in the ill fortune of others. You feel shamed by your attitude. 
11113:It is the way of nature and turmoil to allow the strongest to thrive and the weak to perish. You feel strengthened by your resolve, and some of those who dared to judge you may yet see the wisdom of your words.
11114:You finally catch the witch who stole your child!
11115:Intimidate her into giving the child back, now!
11116:[Witch]You were prepared for this. Burn some wicker, throw three chicken feet at her face, spit seven times over your shoulder, then face her with your spirit!
11117:You kill the hag and find a few children in the sack, some sadly dead already.
11118:Rescue those you can and leave.
11119:The hag defeats you and runs away with the stolen child, never to be seen again.
11120:'Oh, bloody underworlds, fine. Have the kid back and leave me be, you goody-two shoes lot.'{}{}{}{}She leaves the child and a growling dog so that she has time to run away. But the dog turns out to be all teeth and no bark, and it seems to want to hang around you now.
11121:Good. Take them and leave.
11122:You defeat the witch and she cries out in pain and bows to your dominance. {}{}{}{}Be it the effect of your efforts or her own failsafe, the hag turns into a rat and runs off. She leaves her belongings behind, including a large sack where she kept children, some of whom are already dead.
11123:You finally catch the rats that spirited away your child.
11124:[Witch]Try to dominate the vermin from under your evil sister's grasp!
11125:You kill the vermin and get your child back. {}{}{}{}You also find the rats were dragging some half-dead cats with them. Perhaps one can be saved.
11126:The vermin defeat you and run away with the stolen child, never to be seen again.
11127:The rats shiver with fear at your command and scamper away, leaving the child free. {}{}{}{}Within the sack they carried, you find other strange trophies.
11128:You finally catch the rats that spirited away your child. But you realise these are no small vermin. These are fat rats and they seem angry and determined to finish their task.
11129:[Hunter]These fat rats are tougher than normal vermin, but you've hunted them before. Set a trap.
11130:You kill the vermin and get your child back. {}{}{}{}One of the wounded fat rats seems very impressed with your work. If it survives, it may join you.
11131:The vermin defeat you, spread some nasty sickness, and run away with the stolen child, never to be seen again.
11132:Your trap works and you capture the nasty vermin and free your child. {}{}{}{}One of the wounded fat rats seems very impressed with your work. If it survives, it may join you.{}{}
11133:As you fall asleep, your dreams become heavy and unsettling. As you toss and turn, you feel more and more unsettled as your deepest, darkest fears become real and hold you trapped within the nightmare.
11134:You try to wake and in the state of half-waking, you see mares sitting on your chests, siphoning your spirits.{}{}{}{}The surge of panic feeds the demons and you fall back into tormented slumber, knowing they will have their way. When morning comes, you are released, but you are wrecked and exhausted.
11135:You try to wake and in the state of half-waking, you see mares sitting on your chests, siphoning your spirits.{}{}{}{}The surge of panic feeds the demons and you fall back into tormented slumber, knowing they will have their way. For one of you, this night will be the last in the realms of mortal flesh.
11136:A thick, sickly fog descends upon your village and within a few nights, folk begin to fall ill with a heavy fever.
11137:The mist is surely a herald of the occult. Given your knowledge, consider what may be afoot here.
11138:The air carries the taste of the mystical here. Your god's domain may shed more light on what befalls your homes.
11139:[Perception]This is surely a bad omen, but without wise ones, it is hard to decipher. Observe the mist in the hopes of finding clues.
11140:There are too many possible bad fiends to narrow them down without mystical knowledge, so gather the sick and care for them the best you can.
11141:The fevered folk speak strange names, twelve of them, over and over again. This and the mist make you sure a febra has come from beneath the earth.{}{}{}{}The febra are twelve sisters of sickness. You need to know the name of the one who is here to banish it.
11142:Perform a ritual to force the name of the demon out of the sick ones.
11143:[Perception]You also know the demons come from a hole in the ground. Track this hole and attack the demons head on!
11144:[Healer or Intelligence] Try to cure the people and the demon will pass on.
11145:You may not have good healers, but it still feels safer to try to cure the sick and hope the demon goes away.
11146:Speak to the mist and offer a sacrifice to stop this!
11147:You find a deep, dark hole near a sacred oak. {}{}{}{}You see the essence of a demon -- a skeletal, deformed creature -- bound to an angry pack of the bies.{}{}{}{}You kill the bies and will likely banish the skeletal demon too.
11148:[Healer or Intelligence] Actually, you have good medics, so just cure the people and the demon will pass on.
11149:You may not have good doctors, but it still feels safer to try to cure the sick and hope the demon goes away.
11150:The fevered folk weaken by the hour; their flesh seems to slowly rot away before your eyes.{}{}
11151:The name is known to you!{}{}{}{}Anabandaris, the ninth sister, the plague mistress of the rotting. Now you must banish her.{}{}
11152:Perform the banishing!
11153:The name is written on parchment soaked in the sweat of the ill.{}{}{}{}Anabandaris{}{}Anabandari{}{}Anabandar{}{}Anabanda{}{}Anaband{}{}Anaban{}{}Anaba{}{}Anab{}{}Ana{}{}{}{}With every utterance cut shorter, you feel the demon's hold weaken. {}{}
11154:Push on!
11155:The ill gasp for air, but the febra grows weaker as the last of its name is spoken.{}{}{}{}An!{}{}{}{}You thrust the parchment into cleansing flames, and the demon is banished!
11156:Good, now tend to the ill.
11157:You find a deep, dark hole near a sacred oak. {}{}{}{}You see the essence of the febra demon -- a skeletal, deformed creature -- bound to an angry pack of the bies.{}{}{}{}You kill the bies and will likely banish the febra too.
11158:[Healer or Intelligence] Both options seem very hard, but you have good medics, so just cure the people and the demon will pass on.
11159:You kill the bies, and the demon that brought sickness to your homes disappears. {}{}{}{}The fever lets up within hours.
11160:You have wounded the bies, and its master clearly did not like it. Both disappear from your village.{}{}{}{}But you did not kill the demon, and thus many of your folk fall gravely ill. Some may even die.
11161:Do your best to help the sick.
11162:Whatever evil this is, it is better to sacrifice one than risk many. Give a person, be it child or adult, to appease the demon.
11163:Child.
11164:Adult.
11165:No, attack!
11166:You fight the fever tooth and nail, and despite the efforts of a demon fiend, you all remain alive!{}{}
11167:Stay strong and wait for the febra to pass. 
11168:Despite your best efforts, many people fall gravely ill and, in the night, you see the face of a skeletal, deformed creature skulking in the mist, feeding on the pain.
11169:Your blood sacrifice appeases the febra and the demon procession moves on. {}{}{}{}One of the wraiths stays with you, in thanks for your understanding of the circle of life. 
11170:Mourn your dead but welcome the new soul wishing to follow the god's path.
11171:Your cow gave very little milk over the last few days, and it looks sickly.
11172:You speak the tongue of beasts. Go see what is happening.
11173:[Perception]Observe the cow for a few days to see what is happening.
11174:Keep the cow in the house and try to see what is wrong.
11175:Cows are not known for their eloquence, but you gather from the animal that a 'friend' has been visiting her. This friend apparently needs her, and soon she will feel much better and the two of them will be happy. 
11176:The fiend sounds like it may be a demon. Figure out what kind.
11177:Set a trap for the culprit and kill it before it harms the cow further. 
11178:Late at night you spot movement in the barn. You hear a rustling of the hay and, finally, you spot an elongated worm with beady black eyes and a long tubular mouth.{}{}{}{}It suckles from the cow, but as soon as it spots movement from you, it slithers away.
11179:Despite being kept indoors, the cow continues to weaken until, one day, it wakes with an abundance of milk, overflowing to the brim. It also looks much healthier.{}{}{}{}But on its neck, you spot an elongated worm, with beady black eyes and a long tubular mouth. It is almost as if it has become part of the cow.
11180:Well, there is a lot of extra milk now, and the cow seems better, so leave the creature be.
11181:Kill this worm!
11182:This is a rare demon, a gadzon. Someone has cursed your home and awakened the worm.{}{}{}{}It will feed on the cow until the two become one. The cow will grow stronger and give lots of milk, have good calves, and bring good fortune to your farmers.{}{}
11183:Consider the side effects. This is a demon, after all.
11184:Once the cow and the gadzon are merged, both will die if either is killed.{}{}{}{}The gadzon may also decide to infest a sentient being -- typically a child or a weakened person -- by crawling inside its intestines. There, it will fester and may cause illness or death.{}{}{}{}This is why folks typically prefer to kill it fast.{}{}
11185:Think of ways to outsmart it.
11186:The creature proves extremely alert, so trapping it is not an easy task. But once you catch the gadzon, you have no trouble killing the fiend. {}{}{}{}The dead gadzon dissolves into gems. {}{}{}{}You can also use the gem carcass to track the fiend who cursed you in the first place.
11187:The creature proves extremely alert, so trapping it is not an easy task. Whenever you make the slightest move, it slithers away into nothingness. {}{}{}{}
11188:You let the creature be, and the cow seems to flourish. It gives more milk, it gives birth to more healthy calves, and your farm seems more successful for a time. {}{}{}{}Eventually the worm slithers away and the cow dies, but it was a good run.
11189:You let the creature be, and the cow seems to flourish. It gives more milk, it gives birth to more healthy calves, and your farm seems more successful for a time.{}{}{}{}Alas, there's a darker consequence, as one of your people falls gravely ill!
11190:Check to see what ails them.
11191:You kill the worm and while the cow seems weakened for a time, it eventually recovers. 
11192:You kill the worm and the cow dies as well. Worse yet, much of your food stock seems to dwindle and rot away too.
11193:The cow continues to weaken until, one day, it wakes with an abundance of milk, overflowing to the brim. It also looks much healthier.{}{}{}{}But on its neck, you spot an elongated worm, with beady black eyes and a long tubular mouth. It is almost as if it has become part of the cow.
11194:There is a way to be rid of the gadzon even after infestation, so you could risk it to get extra milk and meat from the cow. But of course, the method does not guarantee success.
11195:Risk the infestation for the chance of good fortune.
11196:Kill the gadzon now before it merges with your cow.
11197:You kill the gadzon in time, and the cow recovers. {}{}{}{}The dead gadzon dissolves into gems. You can also use the gem carcass to track the fiend who cursed you in the first place.
11198:The gadzon merges with the cow and the animal does indeed grow in strength and productivity. Your fields grow more abundant and you feel lucky. {}{}{}{}Alas, a person soon falls gravely ill, their stomach becoming hard and sickly with the worm sleeping inside.
11199:Use the method to chase away the gadzon.
11200:You take the infected person to a nearby lake, and there you say:{}{}{}{}'The water is clear, the water is clean -- oh so good for a swim.'{}{}{}{}And the gadzon worms its way out of the host and slithers into the lake. {}{}
11201:Take care of the infected.
11202:You take the infected away and although their illness lingers, it is not dangerous, and you know the gadzon will not return. {}{}
11203:You take the infected away, but their illness lingers and several other people also fall ill. However, you know the gadzon will not return. {}{}
11204:You are not sure what is causing the illness, but their stomach is firm and swollen, and they grow thinner every day despite eating a lot. {}{}{}{}In time, the illness passes, but it spreads and may prove fatal to some.
11205:The dead gadzon's gemstones lead you to a small cave near your village. {}{}{}{}You always assumed it was empty, but you see fresh signs of habitation here.
11206:Use tracking skills to find out more. 
11207:You sneak into the cave and find a single set of humanoid tracks. Deeper in, you discover a campsite.{}{}{}{}You see dried herbs, some rags, bits and pieces, and several things that come from your village!
11208:Sneak in closer to find the culprit.
11209:As you go in closer, you see an old woman reading a scroll and talking to her cat:{}{}{}{}'Bah, they got rid of my gadzon, they did, never got the chance to get the good stuff, did we? We'll have to move along, I guess.'
11210:Attack the thief!
11211:Speak to the woman and demand your belongings back.
11212:She said she is leaving, so leave her be. The stuff she stole is not worth much anyway.
11213:You sneak into the cave and discover a campsite. You see dried herbs, some rags, bits and pieces, and several things that come from your village!{}{}{}{}But before you can take them back, you see an old woman with a cat staring at you, and you feel spiritual energy rising:{}{}{}{}'Begone, or I will turn you into toads!'
11214:The thieving witch lies beaten and pleads for her life:{}{}{}{}'Please, please, I was just trying to get some things, nothing big, and the gadzon's not always bad, never meant to hurt no one, honest!' 
11215:Let her live, but only if she can offer something.
11216:Let her live. She's learnt her lesson.
11217:Kill her because she endangered your village and stole from you.
11218:'Yes, yes, I will pay. The gadzon was not the only demon I captured to serve me. Here, this is a cmuch, it will help you heal.'{}{}{}{}She opens a hidden compartment and shows you a caged cmuch.
11219:Accept and let her live.
11220:'Thank you, and you won't see me ever again, promise.'{}{}{}{}She scampers away in a hurry.
11221:Tell her you could swear this is not the first time you've dealt with her.
11222:'Ehm, no, no. You're mistaken, this time I will not be back, I swear.'
11223:Let her leave, again.
11224:'Oh, right. Well, that went easier than I thought. You're odd. Bye.'
11225:'Oh, right. Well, that went easier than I thought. You're odd. I like it. I will bestow my wisdom on you before I go.'
11226:Thank her and wish her well as long as she doesn't come back to steal again.
11227:You kill the witch, and her cat hisses at you madly before dashing away. {}{}{}{}You feel a curse upon you.
11228:Gather what is here and leave.
11229:You kill the witch, and her cat looks at you with respect. It seems like it wants to stay with you.
11230:'Yeah, yeah, here, have the treasures back. All junk anyway. You dealt with that gadzon quick, I'll say that for you.{}{}{}{}Say, now that we're buddies, you wanna buy a cmuch demon from me? I will take food, wood, or leather as payment.'
11231:Tell her you have nothing to trade. Ask her to go now.
11232:The witch leaves, but her cat stays behind and seems to want to stay with you now.
11233:'Good trading with you. Now I am off, and I promise not to bother you again.'
11234:'No way! Finders keepers it is. Leave, or I'll turn you into toads!'
11235:The witch beats you badly and forces you to flee! You also feel very ill afterwards.
11236:Your village has been unusually sluggish these past few days. {}{}{}{}Folk sleep in, forget to do chores, and wander off midday without purpose.{}{}{}{}Food supplies are beginning to suffer for it, and health issues may follow as dirt and refuse mounts. 
11237:Observe the people closely.
11238:It soon becomes clear that a pack of house demons called niespiech have settled in your homes. {}{}{}{}These little buggers latch on to anyone trying to do housework or chores and make them lazy and sleepy. 
11239:[Magic user or zerca] There is an old incantation that is passed from wise one to wise one, and it should do the trick.
11240:These things physically latch on to a victim and hold them down. So be fast about your chores so they cannot catch up!
11241:Just try to kill the annoying things.
11242:They don't sound too dangerous. Just leave them be.
11243:'A busy bee I need to be on this cleaning spree. No lazy daisy will keep me hazy. No foreign sloth will keep my cloth from making the broth!'{}{}{}{}The creatures perk up and listen.
11244:Continue the chant and usher them away from your village.
11245:Now that you have their attention, perhaps try to use it to your advantage.
11246:You catch the creatures one by one and kill them. It takes forever, as your every move is slowed down. {}{}{}{}Over the coming weeks, many small calamities befall your village before calm is restored once more.
11247:Nothing more to do.
11248:You muster all the strength you have, and together, you do the chores in the village in record time. {}{}{}{}The niespiech look very unhappy with you, and one by one, they fall away into the shadows.{}{}
11249:Before you realise it, you become just as sluggish and lazy as the rest of the folk in the village. {}{}{}{}Eventually, the demons leave, but you feel weakened by their shenanigans.
11250:By spreading cow's urine and virgin's tears onto the bedsheets, you can lure these house demons to transform into one that will serve your village.{}{}{}{}But if it goes wrong...
11251:No. Continue the chant and usher them away from your village.
11252:Yes, try the ritual.
11253:The niespiech huddle together under the soiled sheets and out of the tumult comes a mrucek -- a harmless, catlike ball of fur that dwells behind the stove.{}{}{}{}It chases away all the vermin and makes your cats behave very well indeed. Your village morale increases while the mrucek remains your friend.
11254:The niespiech huddle together under the soiled sheets and out of the tumult comes a liho!{}{}{}{}The cursed demon of darkness haunts your people for several days before it is finally chased away.{}{}{}{}Bad luck strikes your people until the fiend goes away.
11255:The niespiech stay for several days, and folk feel drained of spirit. {}{}{}{}Eventually, the demons seem to disappear, and you think they appreciated that you left them alone. Whether this will mean good or bad things remains to be seen. 
11256:A heavy storm besieges your village for days, and among the rain and the clouds, some people see a figure of a little girl with a crooked face wearing a white dress.{}{}{}{}
11257:Soon it is clear that a cicha mora stalks your homes, tricking children into playing with her while spreading rot and fever.{}{}{}{}Many children fall to her trickery.{}{}{}{}(Dead children may change into bazatka, and live ones attract a dola.)
11258:The cicha mora is a tormented soul. Speak to her as a fellow spirit being.
11259:This demon child is rare and dangerous, a death-bringer of sorts. But perhaps there's a way to banish her. Talk to the creature to see if you can learn more.
11260:[Healer]Take care of the sick.
11261:Help the sick children as best you can. 
11262:The children lived through the fever and a dola spirit was born to watch over their little souls, bringing prosperity and joy. 
11263:Great, get back to village life.
11264:Your healing was not strong enough for all. The children continue to suffer, and one may not survive the night. 
11265:Try your best to care for the sick.
11266:The cicha mora does not say anything, but she does stop to look at you, head tilted, eyes wide open and filled with sadness. {}{}{}{}You sense other forms following her in the shadows, and you feel her own form trapped by some heavy curse. 
11267:If they are bound by a curse in a spiritual realm, you may at least banish them from this wretched existence. 
11268:[Magic user] Try to lift the curse.
11269:[Healer]This is too big of a task. Take care of the sick.
11270:This is too big of a task. Help the sick children as best you can. 
11271:The wraiths are defeated, and you feel their essence unbound from their cursed chains.{}{}{}{}One such wraith lingers and may decide to stay by your side.
11272:Good. Tend to the children and get back to work.
11273:The ritual works and the curse is lifted. The cicha mora turns into a dola and promises to care for one child. The other wraiths are released from their bonds. {}{}{}{}One such wraith lingers and may decide to stay by your side.
11274:Whatever held these souls was too strong for you, and the cicha mora continues her dark work. {}{}{}{}The children continue to suffer, and one may not survive the night. 
11275:A child is taken by the illness, but instead of dying, its tormented little soul is reborn as a karakandza demon. {}{}{}{}It does, however, retain its wits, and it stays with you.
11276:You track down the scoundrels who absconded with your goods!
11277:[Nature and Magic]Take time to investigate. Perhaps you will find an angle here.
11278:You kill the scum and reclaim your goods along with any other loot they may have had.
11279:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. You can't hope to reclaim what was lost now.
11280:'Bah, stop yammering about your bloody gods already. Fine, have the goods back. Just go.'{}{}
11281:'Bah, you're a clever one, ain't ya? Fine, yeah, we do need food, and we'd rather not get into a scrap if we can avoid it.'{}{}
11282:The bandits do as they promised and give your child back.{}{}
11283:Try to convince them to trade for food.
11284:A small group of weary dwarves arrives at your doorstep asking for a place to rest and regain strength. They say they will pay you in stone for some basic supplies.
11285:In the name of light, greet them as honoured guests.
11286:[Dwarf]Greet them in the dwarven tradition of metal and stone.
11287:'Unmovable as stone, sharp as mithril. Aye, you do know the old ways, laddies, and we thank you for the hospitality, even if it is so... basic.'{}{}
11288:Basic?
11289:Ask if they have anything to trade.
11290:You kill the dwarves and loot their goods. 
11291:The dwarves beat you badly but at least they leave you alive.{}{}{}{}They do, however, take most of your food.
11292:'Unmovable as stone, sharp as mithril. Aye, you do know the old ways, laddies, and we thank you for the hospitality.'
11293:Ask what brings them here.
11294:Share hospitality with the dwarves. You do not need to hear their stories.
11295:'We are on our way back to our settlement. We are earthbound. You see, once we lived deep underground, and we do not take well to being away, out in the open, for this long. So we are weakened.'
11296:Ask why they were travelling at all, in that case.
11297:Invite them to rest and share a meal.
11298:'We were investigating an old rubble of stones that was once ours, hoping to reclaim some old resources. {}{}{}{}We came into conflict with the banished, those honourless sods.{}{}{}{}So we had to cut the trip short.'
11299:Banished?
11300:Ask if they will show you where the ruins are.
11301:'Aye, the ones that dishonoured themselves long ago, so now they have no house, and no right to wear a beard.'
11302:Ask if this was not an old law.
11303:'Aye, suppose it is for some. We've allowed many back into our families, but then others left, likin' this new surface life, mixin' with strangers and up to all sorts of honourless crap.'
11304:Ask if they are in conflict, then.
11305:'Nothin' as dramatic as that, laddies, nah. Just some old grudges now and then. {}{}{}{}Like those young upstarts that got us in the ruins. They claimed it's their right as much as ours. We disagreed, so metal and stone flew. Ha!'{}{}
11306:'Take no offence, god follower -- we find most places shabby compared to our once-great cities.'
11307:Ask about those cities.
11308:Take offence at being called shabby.
11309:'I am sorry, laddies, we do not trade with younglings in their shabby shacks. {}{}{}{}You be kind enough to leave us be now. We paid for our board.'
11310:Take offence.
11311:Try to convince them to be more open.
11312:[Elf]Remind them that you can hardly be called a 'youngling' by any standards.
11313:'Right you are, apologies. I do forget that some of you elderfolk went mad and follow those deities.'
11314:The dwarves take the food, leave you the stone, and leave after a short rest.
11315:'Aye, I did know how to keep my bloody mug shut. {}{}{}{}Listen, I meant no offence. We are what we are, and so are you. Let us leave it here. Stone and metal be with ya.'
11316:'Perhaps I was too hasty in making judgement. Living up on the rock instead of under it has made us weary.{}{}{}{}Here, have a look at our stock.'
11317:Decline, but thank them for the offer.
11318:'Well, that was a waste of a conversation. Stone and metal be with ya.'
11319:The dwarves barely listen to your words. They take the food they traded with you and walk off. 
11320:'Dwarven strongholds, carved deep into the earth's core. Metalworks. All gone, shattered, burnt out by the bright. We will speak of it no more.'
11321:'I will not pretend to like your newfangled ways. These human gods... at least some know how to wield a smith's hammer and respect light, so there's that.{}{}{}{}Tell ya what, we do not do this often with strangers, but we can trade some goods, if you like?'
11322:Decline politely, and spend the time telling stories and drinking ale.
11323:'Bah, why not? You are friends, so you can have a go. Just pay your respects when you're there.'
11324:'Well met, friends. Stone and metal be with ya.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves depart on their way.
11325:The dwarves beat you badly but at least they leave you alive.
11326:A small group of weary dwarves arrives at your doorstep asking for a place to rest and regain strength. 
11327:'Ah, followers of Svarog's lot, good on ya, laddies, good on ya.{}{}{}{}Tell ya what, give us some food and we'll stay awhile, maybe teach ya some proper craft -- if we find anyone worthy, that is.'
11328:First ask them what they are doing here.
11329:Decline and offer only the place to rest.
11330:'Brethren, well met, well met indeed. {}{}{}{}Tell ya what, give us some food and ale, and we'll stay awhile, maybe teach ya some proper craft -- if we find anyone worthy, that is.'
11331:'Nothin' particular. We're banished rocks, that's what we are. Discarded long ago for bein' too surface-lovin'. {}{}{}{}So we wander, do business, and other sorts.'
11332:[Dwarf]Ask if by 'other sorts' they mean banditry.
11333:Nod and agree to give food. [Lose 20% food]
11334:Say you cannot spare the food, but offer a place to rest.
11335:'Direct as metal should be, laddie, eh? Right you are, right you are, we do a wee bit of banditry from time to time. {}{}{}{}You don't worry yourself, though -- we'd never rob our own kin!'{}{}
11336:Ask if they have any good loot to trade.
11337:'Good tradin' with ya. So any thoughts on the offer?'
11338:'Good, good, let's see if anyone here has talent to shape stone and metal.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves stay a while and take on students. Though not everyone is likely to learn smithing, you do feel encouraged by the lessons.{}{}
11339:Thank them for the instruction and bid them good journey.
11340:'Understood, times are hard on us all. Stone and metal be with ya nonetheless.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves rest and then move on.
11341:Bid them good journey.
11342:'Ah, followers of that cosmic pantheon, eh? Well, why not, that's what I say. We can share some of our dwarven ale in thanks for your hospitality.'{}{}{}{}You drink and laugh and eat well.{}{}{}{}But in the morning, as the dwarves leave, you realise you were robbed!
11343:Curse the dwarven bandits.
11344:'Ah, followers of that cosmic pantheon, eh? Well, why not, that's what I say.{}{}{}{}Tell ya what, give us some food and we'll stay awhile, maybe teach ya some proper craft -- if we find anyone worthy, that is.'
11345:You kill the bandits and reclaim your goods.
11346:The bandits beat you and laugh in your face for your failure. {}{}{}{}They do not, however, take any more than before. 
11347:You kill the bandits in a preemptive strike. 
11348:The bandits beat you and laugh in your face for your failure. {}{}{}{}They take some of your equipment.
11349:It is not your place to interfere in others' conflict, and you feel your domain strengthened by this resolve.{}{}{}{}You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}You see the dwarves overwhelmed by the unliving, and now you can face the remining threat that is running your way.{}{}
11350:It is not your place to interfere in others' conflict, and you feel your domain strengthened by this resolve.{}{}{}{}You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}You see the dwarves are victorious and running angrily your way.{}{}
11351:You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}You see the dwarves overwhelmed by the unliving, and now you can face the remining threat that is running your way.
11352:You are able to grab a few salvageable resources while the combat takes place.{}{}{}{}You see the dwarves are victorious and running angrily your way.
11353:You spot a group of wind demons, the viatroviec, and you see that they have the child who was stolen from your village not long ago!
11354:Intimidate them into giving the child back, now!
11355:[Vily or viatroviec]Implore your wind kin to let your child go!
11356:You kill the viatroviec and rescue your child and whatever else those demons took from folks.
11357:The viatroviec defeat you and run away with the stolen child, never to be seen again.
11358:'Very well, have the offspring back and leave us be.'{}{}{}{}They leave the child and whatever else they took from folks.
11359:Your kin listen to your pleas and abandon the child in a satchel they carried it in.
11360:Take your child and leave.{}{}
11361:A sudden hailstorm catches you off guard.
11362:[Vily or Viatroviec]Wind is your domain. Try to use it to shield you from the worst of it.
11363:Find cover.
11364:Try to protect the houses and livestock.
11365:Wind gathers around you and shields you from the hail. 
11366:Wind gathers around you and shields you from the hail, but you feel its strength rising with every gust, threatening to whisk you away. 
11367:Stand strong.
11368:You stand against the hailstorm and withstand its power intact. {}{}{}{}You feel strengthened.{}{}
11369:The wind takes you and knocks you about in the terrible hailstorm. Bruised and beaten, you eventually return.
11370:You find cover quickly and try to secure the house, but the hailstorm ravages your settlement without mercy, threatening to destroy much.
11371:Try to figure out how to protect your goods.
11372:Stay in cover.
11373:You strengthen your shelter and keep your goods safe. Some of you even learn a thing or two.
11374:The hailstorm is wild and unforgiving. It leaves you bruised, and you fail to protect your goods from the onslaught.
11375:You take cover in time and, luckily, the hailstorm is not strong enough to destroy anything.
11376:The hailstorm leaves you bruised, but you protected all your valuables. 
11377:A stork is spotted in your village, a sure sign of good fortune from the gods. Unless they are displeased with you of course.
11378:Welcome the stork. 
11379:The stork brought you a child!
11380:The stork brought good fortune and your farm animals have some young.
11381:The stork brought good fortune and blessings from the gods.
11382:The stork brought good fortune and your farms yield better crops.{}{}
11383:The gods seem unhappy with you and you feel their displeasure deeply. 
11384:Try to be better next time.
11385:Your village was left unattended, and it seems some scavengers paid you a visit. {}{}{}{}Who knows what you will find when you return?{}{}
11386:You find the place where intruders were supposed to have settled -- a small but thick grove. {}{}{}{}You see some signs of humanoid presence.
11387:You track the intruders to a cave. Within you spot some movement, and in time you realise they are shadow elves stalking about nervously.{}{}{}{}Luckily for you, there seem to be only a few with weapons at the ready.
11388:You search the place and finally spot some shadow elves. Alas, they spot you too.{}{}
11389:Stop, show your hands, and say you do not wish to fight, only to tell them they need to leave, as the elves do not want them here.
11390:[Strength]Try to look intimidating and tell them to leave this forest!
11391:You are badly beaten, and the elves have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.' {}{}
11392:'We were merely visiting sacred places, honouring our past and familial bonds. {}{}{}{}But some of our cleansed kin did not take kindly to our voyage and attacked us. We are wounded and simply need time to heal before we move on. We seek no revenge on the woodland kin.{}{}{}{}We will leave now, if we must.' 
11393:Say that they do not need to leave. You will explain their situation to the elves.
11394:You stay for some time and help the shadow elves heal. {}{}{}{}'We thank you and leave you this gift to repay your kindness. I do not know how you stomach dealing with those arrogant, stagnant fools, but it is your path. Fare thee well.'
11395:'We have wounded friends, so we are not leaving, and you can tell that to those arrogant do-gooders who sent you here.'
11396:The shadow elves stop in their tracks, staring at you. You know most of them are ready to fight, but one of them speaks:{}{}{}{}'Please, we do not wish to fight. We are merely passing through.'
11397:[Elf]Demand that they leave now, for they are a scourge on your kin and they bring darkness into the fold.
11398:The shadow elves depart, carrying their wounded.{}{}{}{}The elves seem unmoved by this and simply thank you for doing your job well. 
11399:The woodland kin are pleased with your help, or at least they do not show otherwise. They even offer a small reward.
11400:The shadow kin are grateful for your mercy. They stay to heal their wounds, which may take some time.{}{}
11401:The elves are displeased with your resolution, and when asked why, they do not reply directly, only mentioning the taint of darkness and its dangers. {}{}{}{}You gain some favour, but not much.{}{}
11402:The elves are pleased with a peaceful resolution, and they leave you a small reward for your services.
11403:When you inform the elves of your failure, they are disappointed in your efforts. 
11404:You kill the shadow elves. {}{}{}{}The elves are strangely relieved at your news, despite typically disliking violent resolutions. They leave you a reward.
11405:'We were merely visiting sacred places, honouring our past and familial bonds. {}{}{}{}But some of our cleansed kin did not take kindly to our voyage and attacked us. We are wounded and simply need time to heal before we move on. We seek no revenge on the woodland kin.' 
11406:You find wayward forest critters, rummaging through the woodland with no apparent purpose beyond destruction.
11407:[Hunter]Set traps to lure the critters.
11408:[Forest folk]You know forest creatures well, so intimidate the pineconettes into leaving.
11409:The elves asked for the pineconettes to be brought back into the fold, so try doing that.
11410:[Leshy]Pineconettes are your cohorts, so call upon them to obey and cease this nonsense immediately!
11411:[Perception]Investigate further.
11412:[Pineconette] Go in alone and speak to your kin.
11413:You lure the creatures into a corner, change your posture to look more threatening, and whisper that the forest is angry with them. Soon, many of them run away in panic.{}{}
11414:Continue the intimidation.
11415:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You try to speak of the duty to the forest, ancient laws, and commitment.{}{}{}{}The pineconettes listen and promise to behave.
11416:Good, tell them to go join the elves.
11417:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You try to speak of the duty to the forest, ancient laws, and commitment.{}{}{}{}But the forest spirits are strangely agitated and barely able to talk back. They snarl at you and threaten to attack.
11418:You approach your kin and question their unruly ways. You try to speak of the duty to the forest, ancient laws, and commitment.{}{}{}{}The pineconettes beg you to stay with them and show them the right way.
11419:Agree to take on the responsibility. [Lose one pineconette]
11420:Do not allow your forest friend to leave! 
11421:You set the traps and get rid of the creatures. {}{}{}{}But when you report back to the elven folk, they are distraught by your violent ways and your friendship suffers.
11422:A single pineconette does, however, seem interested in your strength. Approach it.
11423:The pineconette is  wounded, but it will live, so you can take it along with you.
11424:You search the debris and discover several pineconettes still alive. Most scatter into the woodland, but one seems to want to stay with you.{}{}{}{}Its eyes seem partially afflicted with an odd light - or is it just your mind playing tricks?
11425:The light is unnatural, and the demon would surely dread the chance of being infected. Kill it swiftly.
11426:You set up traps and kill most of the pineconettes, which turn into white ash. Others scamper away. {}{}{}{}At first the elves are distraught by your violence, but when they see the white ash, they agree this was perhaps the only way.
11427:The pineconettes are triggered and swarm you without reason. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
11428:Your friend is depressed with your decision and the pineconettes become agitated again.
11429:The pineconettes listen and promise to behave. Nature and harmony are satisfied by your actions.{}{}{}{}The elves thank you and leave a reward.
11430:You see a single pineconette lurking. Approach it.
11431:The pineconettes listen and promise to behave. The elves thank you and leave a reward.
11432:You get in closer and observe the pineconettes behaving oddly. Whereas you thought they were simply being destructive, you now see they are chasing one of their own and tearing it apart!
11433:The pineconettes beat you badly and force you to flee. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
11434:The pineconettes lie dead, their bodies turned to ash.{}{}{}{}But when you report back to the elven folk, they are distraught by your violent ways!
11435:You destroy the crazed pineconettes and they turn into white ash.{}{}{}{}At first the elves are distraught by your violence, but when they see the white ash, they agree this was perhaps the only way.{}{}
11436:You see the eyes of the raging pineconettes burn with a bright light, a light that is consuming their fragile bodies, yet they rage on, chasing their brethren who seem normal and unwilling to accept this odd light.{}{}
11437:You scare the rest away and gather up some wood they left behind.{}{}{}{}But when you report back to the elven folk, they are unimpressed with your scare tactics, which they call bullying. {}{}{}{}Still, they recognise your efforts and you gain some small favour.
11438:When you call the forest, it responds, and the strange pineconettes finally burn through entirely, leaving some grateful survivors behind.{}{}{}{}When you ask them what happened here, they do not know. They only know the light tried to take them.{}{}
11439:You approach the area where the rogue forest guardians are said to dwell.{}{}{}{}You see a darkened, enclosed grove and sense many eyes watching you.
11440:[Goblin shaman]Ask the forest spirits to tell you what is amiss here.
11441:[Harmony]Evoke the power of harmony to try to appease this old spirit's anger.
11442:[Nature]Call out to your domain to show the leshy you are on his side.
11443:Offer your own spirit energy to try to appease this old creature and have it leave the elves alone. [Take spirit damage]
11444:One of the leshy turns their ancient gaze on you:{}{}{}{}'The little forest childreen caaled you here, yees? We will noot back away. This forest is ours, and theey are pests!' 
11445:[Leshy]Call out to your brothers and demand they stand down, as it is not their place to attack other forest children when they have done naught to deserve it!
11446:Implore the leshy to listen to reason. Surely the elves are children of the forest too. They cannot have offended him this badly.
11447:[Magic user]This forest guardian seems somewhat unhinged. Enter the spirit realm and fight him there so you may bring some sense into the old wood.
11448:[Orc]These forest demons are out of control. Surround them, plant fires in the right places, and burn them! It will be a challenge to do it fast enough, but you know how to burn forests well.
11449:The spirits tell you that the leshy's soul is still stained by the old taint of darkness. This makes him more aggressive and unstable.{}{}{}{}The spirits offer to cut the leshy off from the spirit world for you, but this will mean a slow and painful death for him.
11450:Do it. A rogue guardian is dangerous for the forest and spirits that dwell here.
11451:Give up. Inform the elves of this. 
11452:The leshy frowns and groans as he listens to your words. It takes time, but the ancient shepherd concedes to your argument and agrees that perhaps the way of the elves is not so bad, and he needs to think less conservatively.{}{}{}{}The elves are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
11453:The leshy does not go easily, and you are wounded by the creature's mad attempts to escape as you try to end it quickly.{}{}
11454:You face the leshy in the spirit realm and find his ancient roots stricken with a dark rot, which you help to clear. The forest guardian thanks you and promises not to bother the elves anymore.{}{}{}{}The woodland folk are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{} 
11455:The elves are distraught by the violent death of a forest guardian. They recognise your expertise and know you spoke truly of the danger, but they remain uneasy about your tactics.{}{}{}{}Your friendship doesn't grow as much as you hoped.{}{}
11456:You give your own spirit and the leshy leaves.
11457:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you find out that the leshy returned to his spot and continued to harass the settlers. They had to deal with it themselves, so your friendship does not grow. 
11458:The elves are concerned about the leshy's mental state, and you feeding him, but they are grateful for your sacrifice and help. {}{}
11459:You destroy the leshy and his demons. But when you report back to the elves, they are distraught by your violent ways and wish they had never asked for your help.{}{}
11460:You are defeated. The elves hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the forest guardian themselves and are angry about having to do so. 
11461:You were unconvincing. The leshy stays put and is resolved to fight the elves.
11462:Whatever you attempted, the leshy proved too strong and stubborn. The forest demons attack you in force.{}{}{}{}The elves hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the forest guardians themselves and are angry about having to do so.
11463:The elves are not pleased that you're passing on the work, but they are impressed that you did not resort to brute force, and knowing how stubborn the leshy is, they will step up their own efforts to deal with it.{}{}{}{}They thank you for trying, although you felt an air of 'Of course they couldn't do it.'
11464:The leshy frowns and groans as he listens to your words. But he is not moved:{}{}{}{}'Noo, I will noot bow doown to their newfangled waays. They will leeave my land!'{}{}{}{}The leshy and his flock attack you, and the elves must come to your rescue. They are saddened by your failure, but appreciate the effort.{}{}
11465:You destroy the leshy and his demons. But when you report back to the elves, they are distraught by your violent ways. {}{}{}{}Despite their sadness, they recognise that the leshy was not right and perhaps it was the only way. Reluctantly, they leave you a small reward too.{}{}
11466:Your plan works and the old forest guardian is too slow to escape the flames. {}{}{}{}The elves, however, are horrified at the destruction of their land and the brutal killing of an elder guardian. Your friendship does not grow.
11467:The leshy looks startled -- which in his case looks really unsettling:{}{}{}{}'I... I aam shaamed by such a young thing. I will do better noow.'{}{}{}{}The elves are very grateful for this peaceful resolution and leave you a gift.{}{}
11468:You find the place where you were sent to deal with some orc bandits.
11469:[Orc Matriarch]Tell them to leave, now!
11470:[Intellect and harmony]Convince the bandits it is wiser to leave than to face you -- and later face the elves too.
11471:Pay the bandits to leave.
11472:You come up to the bandit camp and spot several orcs. They look thin and tired, so there may be room for negotiation, although it is never certain with those so filled with turmoil.
11473:[Orc]Convince them that bothering a small elven settlement is hardly a worthy challenge. Tell them of other places you've come across where their warrior's honour will be better served.
11474:[Bandit]Barter with them. Convince them it is no real challenge to stay with the pansy elves.
11475:Bandits are after goods, so offer them some for leaving.
11476:You know their tactics, so the fight will be easier. Attack!
11477:'Shit, yes, ehm, as you say, this is clearly your turf. Honour to you, blood-mother!'
11478:Watch their every step as they go.
11479:'True enough, elves aren't worth our effort, I suppose. We'll leave you be, friends. For honour!'{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship with the elves will surely grow. {}{}
11480:The orcs scatter and even leave some of their stuff behind. {}{}
11481:'Bah, you talk and talk, and so do the pointy ears, coming here bloody talking from the trees, enough! We leave!'{}{}{}{}They move on and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. 
11482:They move on and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. {}{}
11483:You are about to report your success when you realise the orcs went to the village on their way out and attacked again. {}{}{}{}They were eventually beaten by the elves without your help, and your friendship suffered for it.
11484:They move on and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution.{}{}
11485:You got rid of the problem as you were asked, yet the elves seem disappointed by the bloodshed. {}{}{}{}'They were only following their brutish nature, so death was perhaps inevitable, yet it saddens us that you could not find another way. Still, you did you best.'{}{}
11486:'Agreed! Honour among thieves lives in us. We leave, and may your blades stay sharp!'{}{}{}{}They move on and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. {}{}
11487:The elves hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the orcs themselves, so you gain no friendship.
11488:'Deal's a deal. Solid trading with you.'{}{}{}{}They move on and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. {}{}
11489:'I suppose bothering the pointy ears has been boring. We'll take some goods and even trade with you. No reason to stick around if we get rich.'
11490:'We do not fear you, nor the pointy-ears! But it does seem like a wasted effort. Yeah, you pay us, and we'll go find better enemies.'
11491:You find the small graveyard where the elves think the unliving roam.
11492:[Magic or Magic user] Some dark magic may be at work here. Investigate.
11493:[Magic user or Wraith] Some in your group know about unliving souls. Take a closer look.
11494:[Nature or Light]Cleanse this place of the foul force that violates the laws of your gods.
11495:[Zerca]These wraiths are bound here, and you happen to know by what ritual. All you need to do is bury some silver in the ground and sacrifice one pet, and the wraiths will bother the elves no more. Do it.
11496:You spot several wraiths floating in circles around a single gravestone.
11497:[Wraith]Speak to them, and ask them to move along or leave the villagers be.
11498:You got the jump on them. Attack!
11499:A stench of dark magic hits your senses, and you discover that a cursed figurine atop one of the gravestones is causing the souls of the dead to linger and twist into wraiths. {}{}{}{}It is easy to destroy, but may wound your spirit.
11500:[Magic user or Wraith]You have folk who know about the unliving, so take a closer look.
11501:It turns out the wraiths were called here by a cursed object, but your words snap them out of the trance. They are grateful and do as you wish. {}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship with the elves will surely grow. {}{}
11502:The wrights scatter and even leave some of their stuff behind if you're lucky. {}{}
11503:You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship with the elves will surely grow. {}{}
11504:You bury the precious metal and sacrifice the life essence of one pet, and the wraiths should now stay trapped in the spirit greyworld.
11505:You are about to report your success when you realise that perhaps your knowledge was not entirely accurate. The wraiths remain, and some mischievous demons were attracted by the free metal and now keep stealing from the elves.{}{}{}{}They are eventually beaten by the elven kin without your help, and your friendship suffers for it.
11506:You are defeated and eventually the elves deal with their problem themselves, so you do not gain any friendship.
11507:Your efforts fail, and the wraiths turn their attention to you.
11508:You bind the wraiths to this grave site, and unless someone purposefully breaks your work, they will remain here. {}{}{}{}The elves are unsure how they feel about this development, but you did deal with their immediate problem, and they are grateful.  {}{}
11509:The elves hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the wraiths themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. 
11510:It turns out that the wraiths were called here by a cursed object. Your bond with the gods protects you somewhat, but when you try to release your kin, they are torn apart in great pain.{}{}{}{}Nevertheless, you got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship with the elves will surely grow. {}{}
11511:Your prayers work. One of the gravestones shatters into dust, and along with it, the wraiths are released from their binding and disappear.
11512:'Welcome, what brings you to our humble abode?'
11513:Ask if you can try to befriend some demons that they house here.
11514:Ask if you can visit the sacred oak tree to honour it.
11515:'It is with regard for your well-being that we ask you to move along, as you are no friend of the elderfolk.'{}{}{}{}You do not see anyone, but you feel watched.
11516:'You seek to aid us -- good. We have unruly forest demons roaming the land. Bring them into the fold and we shall be thankful.'
11517:'Yes, it has ever been our way to aid the weary. Enter.{}{}{}{}You may seek our healers, or perhaps rejuvenate the mind and spirit, if fortune gives you the chance.'
11518:Ask if their mages are willing to restore your spirit.
11519:An elven storyteller begins a colourful ballad of the dark night. Sit, listen, and learn.
11520:'You seek to aid us -- good. There is unrest in a beehive not too far from here. We would like it resolved.'
11521:'You seek to offer your services. This is acceptable.'
11522:You have some precious stones. Ask if they need some.
11523:'We do have an issue with a band of orcish brutes nearby. They destroy the woodland and bother us too. They seem unable to listen to reason, but perhaps they will listen to you.'
11524:One of the elves nods and shows you a place to sit.{}{}{}{}'Your soul is tainted and needs cleansing. Curses strain the light of our souls; thus, the price will be high and will strain your minds. Healing your spiritual wounds is easier for me, so I shall not ask much in return.'
11525:[Elf]Tilt your head gently in question.
11526:[Magic users]Say that you know some of the cleansing, but you require their aid to do it properly.
11527:The spirit healer smiles. 'Ah, excuse me, I felt the touch of the young gods and did not expect an elder child. {}{}{}{}Sit, rest, and meditate, and your soul shall be cleansed. Your kinsmen will still need to pay, of course.'{}{}
11528:The elf regards you for a time, and you wonder if they've gone into meditation.{}{}{}{}'I see. The way of your pantheon is most interesting indeed. We accept your gifts graciously. Here, this is a chest of unknown origin I recently found -- it is yours.'
11529:'We do not trade demon lives as pets, but we will allow you to try to befriend a cmuch or skshack, and they may ask a demon-payment from you.'
11530:'We do have some, well, intruders. They set up camp not too far away and we wish them gone.'
11531:A cmuch takes interest in you and will join you if you give him some of your spirit.
11532:A skshack is interested in joining you:{}{}{}{}'You give me some shinies, and I'll be your pal, eh?
11533:Agree. Give two gems.
11534:Alas, no demon wants to join your ranks at this time.
11535:'I see. In that case, I will aid you, and you will do the work. Sit, rest, meditate, become one with the forest, and listen to its wisdom.'{}{}{}{}You feel any dark energy slowly drained away. {}{}
11536:'You may, but be wary, for those who do not walk the elven path may not find it friendly.'
11537:[Nature]Call upon nature to honour the ancient oak.
11538:[Harmony]Ask harmony to soothe the ancient tree and show respect.
11539:[Light]Call upon the power of the sun to shine upon the tree.
11540:[Magic]Call upon the weaves of magic to celebrate this symbol of mystical power.
11541:[Turmoil]Try to remain calm and composed under the heavy stare of the ancient tree. 
11542:Keep your distance and admire the site from afar before moving on.
11543:As you enter the elven settlement, you realise it has changed. The trees are twisted and covered in dark moss, and shadows lurk in every corner. {}{}{}{}This is now a shadow town and its corrupted inhabitants don't seem eager to speak to you.
11544:Ask them what happened.
11545:The shadows whisper:{}{}{}{}'You, you did this. We are cursed now. Many met true death, more will follow . . . others will endure in this corrupted form. Leave us.'{}{}
11546:You approach the beehive the elves asked you to investigate. It is clearly agitated.
11547:[Druid or nature]There's no need for violence. Go in slowly and see what is wrong here.
11548:[Forest folk]Speak to the bees to find out what is wrong.
11549:You are badly beaten. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your violent ways.
11550:The bees buzz in unison, listening to your words. {}{}{}{}They tell you there is a bear stuck in their hive, destroying it. They beg you to kill the beast.{}{}{}{}You spot the bear now, and it is indeed stuck, so it will be easy to kill.{}{}
11551:Agree. Kill the bear.
11552:Look for another option.
11553:You kill the bear and the bees are grateful. {}{}{}{}The elves, however, seem saddened:{}{}{}{}'Was there really no way to avoid senseless death? Still, you did as we asked. I suppose we cannot require more from your sort.'
11554:You helped free the bear, and the bees are satisfied and eventually calm down. {}{}{}{}The elves are impressed with your efforts:{}{}{}{}'I confess I did not think your kind would put so much effort into saving the life of a beast. Here, take this with my thanks.'
11555:You attack the hive and kill the bees, and discover a bear trapped inside the hive as well. You manage to kill it too before it can attack you.{}{}{}{}The elves are dismayed at your brutish nature. They pay you as agreed, but you lose much of their respect.
11556:You could try to free the bear without destroying too much of the hive, but you will likely be injured by both the panicked bees and the hurt bear. 
11557:Kill the bear.
11558:Free the bear, despite the risks. 
11559:You get in closer and spot a bear raging inside the hive. Both the bees and the bear seem angered as the bear thrashes about in the hive, destroying it.{}{}
11560:Kill the bees.
11561:This will likely not be a safe plan, but try to lure the bear away from the bees.
11562:The bees sting you, and the bear lashes out and you must run for miles to lose it. 
11563:Good, report back to the elves.
11564:The elder folk are impressed with your efforts:{}{}{}{}'I confess I did not think your kind would put so much effort into saving the life of a beast. Here, take this with my thanks.'
11565:You are badly beaten. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
11566:'Welcome, what brings you to our haven?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.
11567:Ask if they would train your pets?
11568:Ask if any of the woodfolk would like to join your path?
11569:'It is with regard for your well-being that we ask you to move along, for you are no friend of the elderfolk.'{}{}{}{}You do not see anyone, but you feel watched. 
11570:'Dark magic ever lingers in the dark corners of our woodland. We sense necromancy lurking nearby. Seek it out and get rid of it.'
11571:'Typically, we do not like strangers poking on our land. As friends, you will be granted an exception. {}{}{}{}Elven ruins lie not far from here. If you seek enlightenment, go seek them out, but please, remain respectful of our ancestry.'
11572:'Remnants of the dark curse ever linger in our woods, so many forest demons and even animals behave oddly, to say the least. {}{}{}{}One such place lies nearby. Seek out what ails our forest and make reparations.'
11573:'Remnants of the dark curse ever linger in our woods, so many forest demons and even animals behave oddly, to say the least. {}{}{}{}There is unrest in one part of our precious forest. If you please, go, seek out a solution.'{}{}
11574:'Leave, now!'
11575:'Typically, we do not like strangers poking on our land. As friends, you will be granted an exception. {}{}{}{}A sacred tree lies nearby. If you are judged worthy, you may find enlightenment there. Beware, though, we do not guarantee our kin's affinity to your visit.'
11576:'An unliving scourge blemishes our land. Cleanse it for us, and our friendship will flourish.'
11577:The elf regards you for a time, and you wonder if they've gone into meditation.{}{}{}{}'I see. The way of your pantheon is most interesting indeed. We accept your gifts graciously. Here, this is a chest of unknown origin I recently found - it is yours.'
11578:Say that you do not have the payment and leave.
11579:You approach the area where the pack of unruly vily you were asked to deal with is said to roam.
11580:You know how to handle vily. Try to figure it out.
11581:[Hunter]Stalk these vily for a time and observe them.
11582:[Leshy]Dominate the vily and call for obedience!
11583:You get in closer and observe. The vily are swirling around a single young sapling. They seem crazed, snapping and hissing at the tree. 
11584:[Vily and viatroviec]Join their chaotic flight and try to find out what is happening from within. 
11585:Speak to the vily. Call upon their duty to the forest!
11586:[Magic user]These vily seem taken by some dark curse. Try to break through it to release them!
11587:[Leshy]You sense these vily are held by some odd force. Use your forest voice to call for obedience!
11588:You stalk the vily and observe a pattern you could follow. But your observation would also make it easy to kill them off one by one, quietly.{}{}
11589:Follow the pattern.
11590:You realise that the vily are possessed by some strange spell, but your presence snaps them out of the trance and they become themselves again. {}{}{}{}The winds calm, and the demons return to their duties. The elves are very grateful for your help and the peaceful resolution.{}{}
11591:Some of the vily fight back and wound you.{}{}
11592:You figure out that the vily are in a trance and you observe the pattern of their flight for a time. {}{}{}{}This leads you to a small wooden idol, buried nearby. You destroy it and the vily are released. They fly away in shame, but the elves are very grateful for your clever resolution.{}{} 
11593:You kill the vily. The elves are shocked by your brutality and tell you not to offer help in the future if killing forest kin is your way.{}{}{}{}
11594:The vily beat you badly and the elves have to come and rescue you. They are not happy about your violent ways, so you do not gain any favours with them.
11595:You are unconvincing. The vily continue their odd behaviour.
11596:[Magic user]These vily seem taken by some dark curse. Try to break through it to release them.
11597:Your scheming fails, and you are assailed by the vily.{}{}{}{}The elves hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the vily themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
11598:The vily stop and look at you, shocked at their own behaviour:{}{}'A spell, a nasty spell took us, told us to kill this here... well, in our daze, we thought it was a fiend of darkness. Your words brought us back, and we can fight the curse now. Thank you!'{}{}{}{}The vily fly away and the elves are grateful for your help.{}{}
11599:The elves are glad you did not resort to violence upon your failure. Although they have to deal with the vily themselves, you still gain some friendship.
11600:You realise that the vily are possessed by some strange spell, and for a time it takes you as well. You ravage the woods with your sisters, killing young saplings that could have grown into leshy one day.{}{}{}{}The elves have to step in and stop you, and they are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
11601:The vily hear your forest cry and stop in their tracks. Whatever drove them to this craziness breaks, and they bow down to your will with apologies. They promise to repair any damage.{}{}{}{}The vily fly away but leave you with a present, and the elves are grateful for your help.{}{}
11602:The vily stop and look at you, shocked at their own behaviour:{}{}'A spell, a nasty spell took us, told us to kill this here... well, in our daze, we thought it was a fiend of darkness. Your words brought us back, and we can fight the curse now. Thank you!'{}{}{}{}The vily fly away but leave you with a present, and the elves are grateful for your help.{}{}
11603:You get in closer and observe. Several bears nervously pace in a cave. You think they may be rabid, judging from the poor state of their fur and the fact that they are foaming at the mouth.
11604:[Animal kin]Try to assess whether any of the bears can still be helped, even if it means risking your own health.
11605:[Nature or harmony]Seek divine insight to find out if any of the bears can still be helped, even if it means risking your own health.
11606:[Hunter]Set traps and kill the rabid bears quickly. It is the safest way to stop the disease from spreading.
11607:Kill the bears. It is the safest way to stop the disease.
11608:You stalk the bears and see that some are already dying from rabies. It seems to be an aggressive strain. You also find that the cave entrance where they lie is unstable, so you can trap them within, though it will be a slow death.{}{}
11609:You wrestle the alpha bear and break its neck with your bare hands. The others submit to your dominance and run away. You realise later they were rabid, but luckily you were not infected. {}{}{}{}The elves are glad that you cleared the cave, but less impressed with your brute force and the fact that the rabies will now continue spreading. {}{}
11610:The cave-in was bigger than you expected, and you were hit by some rocks.{}{}
11611:Step away.
11612:You trap the bears and get rid of them safely. {}{}{}{}The elves understand the need to kill rabid animals, but they do not like your cruel methods. Your friendship grows only slightly.{}{}
11613:You give the food away and lead the animals to another spot. {}{}{}{}However, these are rabid animals. Not only do they return eventually, but the elves are not impressed with how you allowed the illness to spread in their forest.{}{}{}{}Your friendship suffers for it.
11614:You kill the rabid bears and the elves thank you for protecting the forest from this dangerous disease, although they are saddened that none could be saved. {}{}
11615:The bears beat you badly and some of you fall sick.  The elves have to come to your rescue and deal with the problem themselves. {}{}{}{}The illness spreads too far, and you are unable to separate the sick bears from the healthy ones. You are bitten and become infected yourselves.
11616:The illness spreads too far, and you are unable to separate the sick bears from the healthy ones. You are bitten and become infected yourselves.
11617:You figure out which bears are strong enough to fight off the disease, and with help from the elves, you separate them from the ones that need to be put down.{}{}{}{}Some of you fall ill or suffer wounds as a result, but the elves are very impressed with your efforts.{}{}
11618:You try to wrestle the bear, but they are all rabid. You put one down, but the rest swarms you and the elves have to come to your rescue. {}{}{}{}They are not impressed with your 'help.'{}{}
11619:Some of the bears are rabid and beyond reach, but some listen to your call. Not only do they agree to leave, but they kill their rabid brethren. {}{}{}{}Within the lair, you find some dead boars[R34], but also a few that may yet live. The elves are happy with your work.{}{}
11620:You observe the bears and see that some are already dying from rabies. It seems to be an aggressive strain. You also find that the cave entrance where they lie is unstable, so you can trap them within, though it will be a slow death.{}{}
11621:Report back to the elves. This seems like a larger problem for them to handle.
11622:The elves are not pleased that you're passing on the work, but they are impressed that you did not resort to brute force. After they manage to save some bears, they thank you for bringing it to their attention and reward you.
11623:You find the lair of the skeletons the elves wanted you to clear. 
11624:[Wisdom and hunter]Set some fire traps and burn those unliving fiends to cinders.
11625:[Unliving only]No need to kill. Tell your unliving brethren to abandon these forests.
11626:[Nature]It is your sad duty to destroy such blemishes. Attack!
11627:[Skeleton]Go in alone and convince your kin to leave.
11628:You prepare a ritual that weakens the skeletons and binds them within a boundary. This will make killing them much easier, or you can face them in the spirit realm and destroy the dark magic that animates them.{}{}
11629:Destroy the source.
11630:This challenge is too great. Come back another time.
11631:You barge into the lair and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods and threaten with the might of divinity. {}{}{}{}Your kin listens, and they scamper away obediently, leaving you free to loot. 
11632:You go in and speak to the unliving, but they are not awakened like you. They follow some master's dark path and move towards you aggressively.
11633:You barge into the lair and throw your weight around. You speak of the gods and threaten with the might of divinity. {}{}{}{}Your brethren beg you to come with them, to guide them away from the dark and onto a better path. But they are not ready to join others. They need you to leave with them.
11634:Agree to take on the responsibility. [Lose one unliving]
11635:You set the traps and the skeletons burn to ash. You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folk who were attacked by the skeletons.{}{}{}{}The elves thank you for getting rid of the scourge, and leave a reward.
11636:You notice one of the horses alive and watching you. Approach it.
11637:At least one of the horses is well enough to come with you.
11638:Take the horse and leave.
11639:You discover the remnants of a ritual and sense an uneasy energy in the air, making you ill. {}{}{}{}You also find a wraith, likely the product of whatever dark arts were performed here. It seems to want to stay with you.
11640:Kill the wraith. It's clearly an instrument of this evil!
11641:You set a trap and the skeletons' odd dance leads them right into it. They lie destroyed, and the body of an old woman lies with them. {}{}
11642:The skeletons defeat your efforts and swarm you. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
11643:You are distraught by the decision, but you listen to your friends and say your farewells to the skeletons. {}{}{}{}They leave, but some already grumble that the old way was better and that they should find some man-flesh to eat.
11644:The skeletons listen to you and move away from the forest. Harmony is satisfied by your actions. You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folk who were attacked by the skeletons.{}{}{}{}The elves are unsure about letting the unnatural scourge go free, but they honour your deal and leave payment.
11645:The skeletons listen to you and move away from the forest. You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folk who were attacked by the skeletons.{}{}{}{}The elves are unsure about letting the unnatural scourge go free, but they honour your deal and leave payment.
11646:You go in closer and realise the skeletons are doing something odd. They are gathered around in a circle, and seem to be... dancing? There is a live person in the middle, directing this strange spectacle.
11647:[Hunter]Use this opportunity as a distraction to sneak up, trap the skeletons in their lair, and burn them all.
11648:[Magic user]Approach this odd menagerie and try to sense what magic is at work here.
11649:The elves are unsure about letting the unnatural scourge go free, but they honour your deal and leave payment.{}{}{}{}You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folk who were attacked by the skeletons.
11650:The unliving beat you badly and force you to flee. The elves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
11651:The elves thank you for getting rid of the scourge, and leave a reward.
11652:The skeletons lie destroyed, and the body of an old woman lies with them. {}{}
11653:Neither the witch in the middle nor the skeletons react to you. Whatever this is, they are entirely enthralled. {}{}{}{}You sense strong turmoil magic here, and you think whatever this ritual is will eventually destroy all of them -- but you could be wrong.
11654:You destroy the binding spell and the unliving collapse in a pile of bones. You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folks who were attacked by the skeletons.{}{}{}{}The elves thank you for getting rid of the scourge, and leave a reward.
11655:The skeletons are destroyed. You also find the remains of a horse cart and dead folks who were attacked by the skeletons.{}{}{}{}The elves thank you for getting rid of the scourge, and leave a reward.
11656:You stay back and watch, and indeed, within hours, the strange dance begins to swallow the skeletons into the ground. The lady in the middle looks at you, smiles, and turns into dirt. {}{}{}{}You feel a blessing of the earth upon you.
11657:Good, gather what you can from the remains and leave.
11658:You stay back and watch, and indeed, within hours, the strange dance begins to swallow the skeletons into the ground. The lady in the middle looks at you, smiles, then absorbs the energy left by the unliving and disappears.{}{}{}{}Some of the lingering energy also strengthens you, and a wraith formed from this odd ritual sticks to you.
11659:You find the place where you were sent to deal with some orc bandits that have been destroying the forest and attacking the small settlement.
11660:Pay the orcs to leave.
11661:'Agreed. Your honour is strong. We will not challenge it this day.'{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow. {}{}
11662:They move on, and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. {}{}
11663:They move on, and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution.{}{}
11664:You got rid of the problem as you were asked, yet the elves seem disappointed by the bloodshed. {}{}{}{}'They were only following their brutish nature, so death was perhaps inevitable, yet it saddens us that you could not find another way. Still, you did your best.'{}{}
11665:'Agreed. Your honour is strong. We will not challenge it this day. We will leave.'{}{}{}{}They move on, and the elves are impressed with your peaceful resolution. {}{}
11666:The elves hear of your failure and come to your aid. They have to kill the orcs themselves and are angry about having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
11667:'Bah, shut your puny mouth, you turncoat. We'll practise our blades on your traitor skin!'{}{}{}{}The orcs attack. 
11668:As you look up at the trees, you see the remains of an old elven dwelling with fallen rope bridges and abandoned structures that have become almost entirely part of the trees again. {}{}{}{}Who knows what secrets it may hold?
11669:As nature is your domain, call upon it to ask the forest for help in this climb.
11670:You climb up and find a series of abandoned tree houses, but most are now inaccessible and overgrown.{}{}{}{}You find some scattered herbs and pieces of usable wood, but little more. But you do hear a strange, disturbing mumbling sound nearby.
11671:[Animal kin] Intimidate the crows.
11672:With the crows gone, you search the room in peace.
11673:Offer some of your spirit health to ease his mind. Maybe he'll talk to you.
11674:'I... thank thee, kindred spirits, for even this fleeting moment of clarity sings to my soul in the most sublime fancy.'{}{}{}{}He hums a sad, striking melody. Then suddenly, you see him twist in pain and his eyes glow with a faint light. Rocking again, he screams at you:{}{}{}{}'End this, end this sorrow now, I beg thee!'
11675:[Harmony]It is not the way of harmony to destroy life, even tormented life like this. Call upon your domain to try to shield the poor creature from whatever ails him. 
11676:The forest listens. Vines and roots from the tree engulf the elf in a protective shell. {}{}{}{}You see his body slowly relaxing, his skin turning more silver until it looks like a perfectly carved, serene statue of a sleeping divine. {}{}{}{}You see a bundle clad in oak leaves and know this is your reward, be it from the forest or the elf. {}{}
11677:The elf looks at you, bewildered:{}{}{}{}'Creature of the dark, turmoil? Chaos? Violence is all it speaks, violence... perhaps the light is good, yes, perhaps, perhaps it is time to embrace it...' {}{}{}{}He starts to glow. 
11678:'So... brutal, your kindred, so... simple... Yet a moment's respite... fleeting so...'{}{}{}{}Then suddenly, you see him twist in pain and his eyes glow with a faint light. Rocking again, he screams at you:{}{}{}{}'End this, end this sorrow now, I beg thee!'
11679:[Light or harmony]Call upon your domain to protect you from this dark power. 
11680:[Turmoil or Magic]Call upon your domain to shield you from the darkness.
11681:[Magic user]You have skilled wise ones with you. Battle this force of the dark with your spirit!
11682:Assert that you follow the path of Dievanna, and surely even they respect her as one of their own.
11683:'Dzievva, the huntress, yes, young though she may be, she is of our sort. We can see now that you are worthy to test your mind and soul in the spring. {}{}{}{}Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back. Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
11684:'You come here in the presence of orc filth, brethren. {}{}{}{}They have no respect for nature, just a constant need for change, movement, violence. No, you cannot be granted the boon!'
11685:Ignore the slight and ask why they dwell here still.
11686:'You show much restraint for a rabid pup. How quaint. {}{}{}{}Now, leave. This is no place for mongrels. We guard a sacred spot, and we will not allow your presence to spoil its serenity. Do not test our resolve.'
11687:'You speak well, and you are one of our own. We can see now that you are worthy to test your mind and soul in the spring. {}{}{}{}Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back. Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
11688:'You speak well. We will make an exception and allow you to test your mind and soul in the spring. {}{}{}{}Remember, the spring takes from you before it gives back. Go forth, and may she of the forest guide your path.'
11689:You find a chest with some weaponry, but just as you reach for it, an unstable building above crumbles down on you, leaving many bruises.{}{}{}{}Still, you get the chest.
11690:You give your spirit essence and the forest calms, for now...{}{}{}{}You are free to search the ruin.
11691:'Agreed, yoou smell of woodkin. Yoou maay passs.'
11692:You step in closer and hear a faint rustling of leaves. You look up and see some bows aimed at you. {}{}{}{}'What do you seek in this sacred place?'{}{}
11693:Bow in respect and say you have come seeking wisdom from the elves.
11694:'Thank you.'
11695:'Since you are here, we have a boon to ask. A corrupted spirit invades this sacred place, and we are bound not to leave this tree. The spirit resides not far away and can only be dealt with there. Will you help?{}{}{}{}All you need to do is carry this branch to the place. It will trap the evil spirit and prevent it from pestering the memory tree.'
11696:You kill the spirit -- or rather, the spirits, which proved to be pineconettes. {}{}{}{}You feel a growing, heavy stare of the forest upon you.{}{}
11697:You fail to kill the spirit and feel a growing, heavy stare of the forest upon you.{}{}{}{}You get the sense that you are lucky the elf guards cannot leave their post.
11698:You kill the guardians and try to loot the tree of its crystals, but each one you touch simply turns into dust, and you feel a sickness befall you.
11699:You kill the guardians and try to loot the tree of its crystals, but each one you touch simply turns into dust.{}{}{}{}With every disappearing crystal, you feel a stain on your elven soul.
11700:The ritual fails, and the creature dies in great torment. The woodland close to it withers away also. {}{}{}{}You get the sense that you are lucky the elf guards cannot leave their post.
11701:Something goes wrong, and the branch twists into a dried-up piece of coal, while the spirit seems to grow more unruly. When you report back, the guards nod solemnly:{}{}{}{}'You did what you could. We should not have asked this of a stranger. Fare thee well, traveller. We must focus on protecting the memory tree now, until our guard change.'
11702:Listen to the song, but stay vigilant.
11703:The melody is entrancing, but you know this may be dangerous. You focus and see a ghostly figure sitting on a branch and looking at you with a pleasant smile:{}{}{}{}'So, your will is not a plaything. Good. What seek you here, stranger?'
11704:Yes, you have heard of your kin cursed by darkness --  shadow kin. Wish them good fortune in cleansing their taint and ask if you can obtain a blessing from the memory tree.
11705:'True, you are elven, even if somewhat misguided, and thus I can offer you a boon. Pick one of the memory crystals and take its blessings with you.{}{}{}{}I will also allow you to reach for the ones up top, for they carry greater blessings, but you must face a challenge to take them.'
11706:'You are elven and you speak plainly with me, and thus I can offer you a boon. Pick one of the memory crystals and take its blessings with you.{}{}{}{}I will also allow you to reach for the ones up top, for they carry greater blessings, but you must face a challenge to take them.'
11707:'Such desires can lead you astray, young one, so be wary of them. {}{}{}{}Yet I do not sense malice in your intent, so I will allow you to face a challenge of your wits or spirits. If either proves to my liking, I will grant you the boon from the memory tree.'
11708:'The memory tree is a place of remembrance for elven souls who chose ever-sleep. Before joining the light, they cry a single tear for the material lives they lived here, and they leave those tears to be remembered by. This is what you see here. {}{}{}{}The tears can grant boons if given by a guardian, willingly.'
11709:You attack the ghostly figure to no avail, and instead you find yourselves assailed by strong magic!
11710:The memory tree deems you unworthy, and your soul feels wounded from this rejection.
11711:You come closer to the tree and realise that out of one of the roots grows the figure of an elf -- a wooden statue, lifelike yet clearly static. There are several ornaments made of precious stones and metals on the statue -- a tiara, some rings, and a decorative chest piece. 
11712:The carving is too delicate, the design too imperfect in its absolute perfection. This must the sacred elven ever-sleep. Like some of your own ancient kin who fall to stone upon death, the elves are said to choose their time of death and turn into statues before their spirit forms float away.{}{}
11713:You know this statue to be an elf who entered the ever-sleep but has not shed the physical coil entirely. In such a state, the elven kin can remain for centuries, still aware of what happens around them and able to awaken if needed, but resting and contemplating at the same time.{}{}{}{}The ever-song soothes such sleepers and tells them of your own life path.{}{}
11714:You feel an energy trying to escape from this plane, but you also sense a stifling force keeping it unnaturally bound.{}{}{}{}You can attempt a ritual to help free this soul, but if you fail, it could harm you.
11715:An armed group of woodland-kin elves stands before you:{}{}{}{}'Drop your goods and surrender. We do not wish for blood, but neither will we tolerate your presence.'
11716:Assert that if they wish for no bloodshed, they will yield to you, now!
11717:'We are not enemies, but neither are we friends. If you wish to amend this, go seek out our dwellings.'
11718:'It seems your brutish nature prevails. We surrender, for we do not wish to harm you.'{}{}{}{}They depart, and some drop their goods before you.{}{}
11719:Your words don't work. You get chased away and beaten.
11720:'You seem, agreeable. We shall depart. Be well, friends.'
11721:'Welcome. I am Nai-ysir, a guardian. I wish to speak to you urgently. It is a troubling time, yes? The lightbringers, as they have become known, are a sign of light's dominance, something we feel very strongly. {}{}{}{}I will admit that many of our kind have either willingly joined them or refuse to act against them. After all, we are born of light.'
11722:So they will not help?
11723:[Elf]The support is as widespread as that? Isn't this suspicious? The elder kin were sworn to uphold harmony and balance.
11724:'The council was called as soon as the earth shattered, of course. A swift decision is needed. They are, however, still deliberating. It may take some time to come to a unanimous decision, you see.'
11725:[Elf]The council has been deliberating for decades now, haven't they? 
11726:How much more time? 
11727:'One should hope they'll be done in this century. ' The elf gives an odd little giggle, then looks at you and tilts their head:{}{}{}{}'Oh. Yes. For you this may not seem jovial, since you folk are always in such a rush to do everything.'
11728:The world is shattering . . .
11729:'Yes, indeed they have, and it may take a few more to reach an agreement. We have not been this divided since before the Awakening. It is troublesome to say the least.{}{}{}{}And since you are kin, I will say that I find it peculiar how the council knew exactly what happened and the ramifications in such detail, almost as if one of them could provide an account . . .'
11730:That is troublesome, yes. But with the world shattering, will they really do nothing now?
11731:'It is shattering and will continue to do so for a considerable time. These things do not just happen over a mortal lifetime or two. {}{}{}{}But I did not come out here to offer discouragement. I am concerned that this conflict may harm us. So I would rather help you resolve the matter.'
11732:Good, how?
11733:'Yes, many of the eldest who survived darkness, they crave the light, you see. So I believe they are allowing themselves this folly for the sake of nostalgia. Ridiculous as it may be.{}{}{}{}The council was called as soon as the earth shattered, of course. A swift decision is needed. They are, however, still deliberating. It may take some time to come to a unanimous decision, you see.'
11734:'I should imagine that you need a new heart to replace the earth-heart that was destroyed. And ordinarily, the forest could provide you with an alternative. {}{}{}{}But as I said, this conflict created an impasse. Now, if you were to prove that an elf took active part in the Shattering, that would shake those old fools in the council and give you the support you need.'
11735:And is there such proof? Did elves do it?
11736:'Not as a whole, no. But individually - yes, I believe so. There is a young, rebellious mage, Ail'yleth. She has quite the silver tongue. I am pretty sure she has meddled in this. Here, I marked her hideout on the map. But beware, she has many protectors. And pray you do not fall for her charms!'
11737:You take a few steps and you find yourself back in the elven town, Nai-ysir welcomes you:{}{}{}{}'You have returned with Ail'yleth. I did not think it possible. Don't worry we will return you to where you were once we are done here. Alas, I have troubling news, and I feel terrible having to share it after you have already done so much for me.'
11738:What is it?
11739:'I have been following your progress. All elves share a faint connection - a much weaker form of what lightbringers have. In any case, I have informed the council of your success and they are forever stubborn.'
11740:They will not help, even now?
11741:Nai-ysir makes an odd face and then speaks as if a child mimicking an adult:{}{}{}{}'We thank thee for this aid you have provided, child of the gods. But it is not our custom to rush to judgement, especially not for our own kin. Ail'yleth will face us, but it will take time to determine our course of action.'
11742:What!
11743:'But worry not, I have already assembled allies and won the right for you to address the council with me. Together, I believe we can convince them to - excuse my language - move their bottoms!'
11744:Agree and go to the council to make your case.
11745:[Intelligence]Tell her you will instead prepare a factual account of all the evidence and thus plea with the council on intellectual grounds.
11746:The council listens and their speaker turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Nai-ysir, you have chosen your allies well. We believe your cause to be true, and furthermore, we accept culpability of the elven folk in this disaster. As such, we will make the necessary sacrifice to ensure that balance is restored as soon as possible and with the least loss of life.'
11747:Tell them it is about time they did something!
11748:'Go back to your red cave where the Alchemist awaits. We will provide a new earth-heart as well as aid in defeating the light-beast that sits in the heart chamber. You have our solemn word on this.{}{}{}{}I believe Nai-ysir wishes to accompany you to achieve this goal?'{}{}{}{}The druid nods.
11749:Thank them for the aid and leave.
11750:[Elf]How exactly are they making this heart? As far as you know, it is not a craft of the elder kin to forge living stone hearts, and the giants are long gone.
11751:'You will learn of it in due time. Fear not - your connection with the gods will shield you from what we must do. We will not say more until the time is right. Go.'{}{}{}{}The council members slowly depart the room and leave you with Nai-ysir.
11752:'No, we shall not be swayed by outsiders. We must consider this calmly. Leave us.'{}{}{}{}The council departs and Nai-ysir stands beside you, stunned:{}{}{}{}'I . . . I cannot believe this. Even now they will not act. It means they agree with her. I am sorry. But I will join you and aid you in finding another way!'
11753:Thank her and leave together. Perhaps finding the dwarven prisoner the Alchemist spoke about is your best bet now.
11754:You find the lone tree you were told about and follow it to a grand cave by a waterfall. There, you were told the elven mage Ail'yleth lives. 
11755:Go in and call out to the mage.
11756:'Welcome. I admit I am surprised my kin felt it necessary to send outsiders here. Then again, I suppose it is a wise move. {}{}{}{}If you fail, their hands are clean, and if you succeed and bring me in, they will take the credit. Yes. I see it now.'
11757:So she admits there is something she can be taken in for? Bringing about the Shattering?
11758:Tell her you are not here to play games. Elves may have the leisure of time on their hands, but your people do not. You are here for some answers!
11759:'If you think that getting one to admit one's designs is as easy as that, you are somewhat more naive than I had hoped for from a champion of the cosmic tree.'
11760:[Light, Nature or Harmony]Call upon your domain and implore Ail'yleth to tell you the truth.
11761:[Elf]Say that you understand the call of the light, the warmth of its touch, and even the promise of its pure revenge against the darkness that once almost wiped out your kind. But ask her to tell you the truth nonetheless. It is not seemly to lie to one another.
11762:[Orc]Tell the elven filth she had better tell you what she did, or you will piss darkness all over her shiny face!
11763:What is her goal? Does she want the lightbringers to take us all and the Shattering to destroy the land?
11764:How did she manage it -- the Shattering, the destruction of the earth-heart?
11765:Ask for the briefest possible account of what is going on. You have no time for talk.
11766:'Your heart is pure as you follow your divine path, yes. But your pantheon also worships turmoil and magic derived from darkness itself - and the cold embrace of intellect that during the Awakening led your kin to destroy your very tree. {}{}{}{}So how can one listen to your plea when only a part of you is true?'
11767:And why does she say magic is also dark?
11768:How did intellect bring about darkness? 
11769:'Yes, it is shameful to speak untruth to one's own kin, yet are you such? Did you not forsake our cause when you decided to follow the footsteps of Veles and the young upstart Dievanna who, like you, left our ranks to join Them?{}{}{}{}It is you who has broken the trust, friend, thus I feel no duty to speak truthfully in your presence.'
11770:'Things are rarely as simple as they seem. Yes, the lightbringers seem dangerous to you, but what do they actually do? They unite us in a symphony of light. One mind and many, forever joined. No conflict, no strife. Almost as it was in the primordial light, and trust me, it was glorious. Shedding this physical connection, the flesh and everything that comes with it.'
11771:But isn't that stealing our will, taking our individuality away?
11772:A brief shadow of annoyance crosses Ail'yleth's face before she regains her composure:{}{}{}{}'Well, case in point. This is precisely why a cleansing is needed.' 
11773:[Orc]She wants revenge, nothing more. Tell her you smell the hate on her pretentious skin. Her pretty sweat reeks of anger and loss. How very unlike a creature that pretends to be stoic.
11774:[Goblin]Not all darkness is bad. One rude orc does not a case make. Goblins have long been friends to the elves. Is she truly fine with condemning your kin too?
11775:This light of hers will take many innocent lives. Is she truly fine with that? 
11776:'Yes, yes! And I appreciate how terrifying it may seem to creatures so used to their mortal coil, but try to expand your mind. {}{}{}{}It isn't taking anything away -- it is simply uniting all in true equality. When did we ever strive for change? What you call progress only brings strife, war, anger, violence, and intolerance. Why have it? Why not settle for one mind in unison, peace?'
11777:[Light]It sounds like a perversion of your domain. An extreme that should not be.
11778:[Light or Harmony]Yes, you can see her point. If lightbringers take all, the world will be safer and more peaceful. 
11779:[Wisdom]It sounds like a lot of bitterness speaks through her. Is this really a quest for the world to find peace, or one to rid herself of mortal emotion, of humanlike connections in favour of one mind that will not distinguish her pain from another, and thus make it all go away?
11780:It is controversial, but perhaps she has a point. What is her suggestion, then? If you let the world shatter, how does that bring peace?
11781:This is folly -- neither light nor darkness should rule, for the people of Thea will suffer. The gods were charged with safeguarding balance, and you shall follow their path. Did she forget that elves made such vows too?
11782:'The world will not shatter if we help the light get out fully. You see, it is the great power of luminescence, trying to tear free from its ancient chains, that is in fact breaking the land. {}{}{}{}But if we facilitate a full release, we shall stop this Shattering you speak of and hasten the path to peace and harmony. Surely your deity will also thrive in this new world, no? Unchained, unburdened from the others who are not pure in their purpose.'
11783:'The world will not shatter if we help the light get out fully. You see, it is the great power of luminescence, trying to tear free from its ancient chains, that is in fact breaking the land. {}{}{}{}But if we facilitate a full release, we shall stop this Shattering you speak of and hasten the path to peace and harmony.'
11784:Ail'yleth slumps her shoulders and looks away. A single tear runs down her chin and turns to crystal as it falls:{}{}{}{}'Have I truly been so deceived? Did I fall into the trap that I set for others? Your words confuse my purpose. I am no longer certain of my path, and without this certainty, can I commit to it all? No, I cannot. At least not now. Perhaps another way will present itself in due time.'
11785:Will she help you stop this, then? Will she hand herself over to the elves so they may aid you in restoring the earth-heart?
11786:Ail'yleth frowns and you see her hand shake:{}{}{}{}'Filth like you is why light needs to burn all! None of your kind will survive the purge. You will not join us in peace and tranquillity, for you do not deserve it. Your words make my conviction certain. Kill me or leave, but I will not aid your lost cause. Light will prevail.'
11787:Apologise for the rudeness, but try to make her see how she will destroy free will by allowing light to take all. Without darkness, what will light even mean? Nothing. Surely, she believes that true peace comes with accepting all, not having it her way?
11788:She is beyond reason. Attack her and drag her back to the elves!
11789:Ail'yleth frowns and lets out a sigh:{}{}{}{}'Yes, the fate of your kind and some of the elder demon kind does concern me. But is it not worth paying the price? Peace and harmony for this land, the end to suffering, violence, and the corruption of darkness - is that not a goal worth reaching? Surely light was ever destined to rule over darkness?'
11790:[Goblin]Say that your kind has long been committed to the forest folk, to old traditions and the greyworld that holds the spirits of this land. Is she truly going to be the one to destroy the order of things? That sounds like something a creature of turmoil and darkness would relish, not one who serves order.
11791:'Scholars devoted to intellect frowned upon the mystical and sought to rid our world of all magic. If not for my intervention, they would have succeeded in burning the tree and later destroying the seed.'
11792:'They corrupted champions of your gods and had them burn what they thought to be the last seed of the cosmic tree. {}{}{}{}But I managed to convince some fools to destroy the earth-heart in time. The light that escaped helped the cosmic tree to be reborn. You and your gods, you owe me.'
11793:That is not the story you have heard; the cosmic tree was saved by the champions.
11794:Nod, but ask what her plans are now. For the land to shatter?
11795:'Trust the stories of fallible mortals or those of an eternal being who bore witness to the mortal fallacy that was the burning. I care not which version you trust.'
11796:'Magic practised by mortals, or near-mortals even, the one that is your divine domain, it comes from darkness. Only elves can harness light for mystical power, which is why we do not grow old, or go insane when we use it. And while I recognise that entropy and change are not evil, they do tend to bring a lot of strife and conflict into the world.'
11797:'Details are of no importance. I saw a need. I sensed that the wheel of mortal life would eventually lead you to darkness again. My kin would once more bear the brunt. {}{}{}{}I found some lost souls, fed them what they needed to hear, and used your own gods to lead the silly sheep to the earth-heart. Once again, people proved how easily corrupted they are.'
11798:But she was the one corrupting them!
11799:'That is of no consequence. I showed them a path and fuelled their weak desires, and they followed without question. They defiled the relics of humans, elves, and goblins alike. They destroyed a pillar of balance. For what? A goddess I told them was in need and would reward them when she is freed, when all the while she was free, performing her duties, unaware of the fools.'
11800:She sounds awfully proud of her work. That is a lot of spite for an elder kin claiming to favour harmony and peace.
11801:'Perhaps. It is the sad truth of every champion that we dabble in what we fight against, no? I have been in this mortal world for too long. I will not lie to myself and say that I do not cherish my victories.'
11802:'Nyia, the one who now bears the duties of Veles and Morena, the newest lady of death - back then she was merely one of the many daughters, messengers. {}{}{}{}I suppose my ruse did force the death of the old gods, and thus Nyia rose to divinity. In that way, I did not deceive the fools.'
11803:'Oh no, no, please do not choose that path! I shall go with you to the prison of the dwarven grandmaster. He shall forge a new heart for you. {}{}{}{}For if we go back to my kin and they decide to aid you, they will feel the guilt of my actions, they will seek to bear responsibility. I fear for what they will sacrifice to aid you. Please do not make me go down that path!'
11804:So will she help you get the dwarf out of the prison and reforge an earth-heart? 
11805:No, Nai-ysir sent you here to bring Ail'yleth to justice, and that is what you will do.
11806:'Yes, this I will do. I swear on the evergreen elf-trees and the sacred light that birthed my soul - I will fulfil this oath and forsake my path of aiding the lightbringers. May my soul turn to darkness if I break this promise.'
11807:[Elf]Accept her oath, for you know she cannot break it without consequence.
11808:'My lightbringer allies have forsaken me after hearing my change of heart. But even alone, I would rather be killed by you than play any part in bringing my failure back to my home.'
11809:Take her in by force!
11810:You beat Ail'yleth and bind her. You can now take her back to the elven city for judgement.
11811:Ail'yleth defeats you and runs away: {}{}{}{}'You may have changed my mind about the lightbringers, but your own violent ways only deepen my fears for this world. I leave you to your path, and you leave me to mine. Go seek your solutions elsewhere, and leave us elves be.'{}{}{}{}She disappears into the cave.
11812:Leave and try to find a different way, perhaps rescue that dwarf?
11813:'Good, yes. Let us go to the prison and free the old grandmaster. He is a runesmith of magnificent skill, but he carries a dark heart, so be wary of him. I will travel by myself and meet you there.'
11814:Thank her and leave. 
11815:Ail'yleth looks at you with a weary expression:{}{}{}{}'Your words cannot change the centuries of destruction and chaos I have witnessed. I may be called traitor now, but I will bring peace to this land. Leave. I do not wish for any violence here, but I will defend myself if needed.'{}{}
11816:You defeat the elven mage and can drag her back to her kind for judgement - and then hopefully you will get the help you need from them.
11817:Ail'yleth defeats you, and her lightbringer allies drain some of your spirit before she allows you to escape:{}{}{}{}'Leave, for I do not wish for more violence here, but I will defend myself if needed.'{}{}
11818:'Good. In that case you may aid me in ensuring our goals. I know where an entrance to the heart chamber lies and will mark it down for you. I will bring an artefact of the light to the chamber, thus strengthening the light-beast that resides there and so create a wider opening for it to be free. {}{}{}{}I will then create an illusion to shield the chamber from future champions and so give time for the light to truly come out.'
11819:Tell her you will meet her at the cave. 
11820:'You return, how quaint. Did you come for violence, or to join me in bringing light to the world?'
11821:Yes, you have come to realise she is right. You wish to strengthen the lightbringers and bring peace to this land.
11822:This is folly - neither light nor darkness should rule, for the people of Thea will suffer. The gods were charged with safeguarding balance, and you shall follow their path. Did she forget that elves made such vows too?
11823:'A brief account, yes. I am a champion of light. I wish the lightbringers to succeed so we may all become one, at peace. True equality and harmony.{}{}{}{}I caused the Shattering, but if you follow my plan, the earth will stop breaking in time. Light will rule over darkness once and for all.'
11824:You find a cave where you were told the elven mage lives, but it is abandoned.
11825:'You lie! We can sense it. You do not bring a true heart here. You bring the end of what is supposed to be. Turn back or die!'
11826:'Damn you . . .'{}{}{}{}The stone and metal statues crumble, and you enter the heart chamber where the carcass of a zmey taken by the lightbringers looms over a gaping hole. It goes right into the core of the earth.
11827:The guardians defeat you and throw you out of their territory. One of you is turned to stone!{}{}{}{}Ail'yleth speaks:{}{}{}{}'I will await here for your return if you choose to face them again.'
11828:Ail'yleth brings in her artefact, which you now recognise as one of the cosmic seeds, enhanced with more light.{}{}{}{}She chants a spell and the light-beast grows and spreads. She shouts to you:{}{}{}{}'Let us leave fast, for our task is completed. In time, the fruits of our labour will ripen.'
11829:Run out before the light devours you.
11830:You come to the entrance of the heart cave as directed by Ail'yleth.
11831:Look around for the elf mage.
11832:'I am here. But we did encounter a slight complication. The path into the light chamber is guarded by dwarven statues. It seems your Alchemist reactivated the old security network, likely suspecting your change of heart.{}{}{}{}So let us kill those stone fools and proceed to free the beast.'{}{}{}{}
11833:Go forth to face the guardians.
11834:The entrance to the light-beast cave is barred. Clearly you needed Ail'yleth to go this way.
11835:You come back to the cave where Ail'yleth awaits. 
11836:The shadows whisper:{}{}{}{}'We paid the price for restoring balance. We know you did what had to be done, we aided you willingly. Yet our pain is great, thus we must be allowed time to heal. Be well, friend.'{}{}
11837:'You are accompanied by beasts that serve you, and I sense they do so willingly, else I would liberate them. But their potential is not fully unlocked in your presence. For a fee, they will walk the druid path with us and thus become more.'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will raise to  fourth rank and you can only train one pet at a time]
11838:Yes, give a horse to be trained.
11839:Train your cock.
11840:'Alas, felines should be respected as they are.'
11841:Your turtle returns after a while and it seems much wiser.
11842:Your cock returns stronger and prouder than ever.
11843:'You seek for our kind to join yours? An odd idea, but not without its merits. It is unlikely any of the elders shall undertake this path, but a youngling may wish to explore such adventurous life. Those who expressed interest await you.{}{}{}{}You will of course leave the customary gift in exchange for their service.'{}{}{}{}[You can only recruit in this faction once, with a tiny chance for second when your population is very low]
11844:Ask a gatherer to join you.
11845:Ask a craftsman to follow your path.
11846:Ask the child if they really wish to come with you?
11847:So you have to pay to hire them?
11848:A guardian seems interested, approach them.
11849:A banished druid awaits, ask them to join.
11850:'Please leave the gift by the tree, or depart quietly, thank you.'
