1:You come across a seemingly abandoned dwelling. 
2:Investigate.
3:You spot an abandoned house. As you come closer, you see a sturdy old tavern built of stone. From the overgrown greenery, unused yard, and broken wooden doors, you assume it is abandoned. 
4:Go in.
5:Leave.
6:The old inn smells of rot and trash. But you find a hidden trap door under the floorboards. 
7:Use your tools to open the trap door. 
8:Break the door open.
9:You smash the trap door, but the impact also collapses some of the floor beneath you, and you fall into a dark cellar.{}{}{}{}Your fall was softened by a swarm of slithering, angry vipers!
10:Attack!
11:Run away!
12:You open the trap door skilfully, and you see a nest of vipers slithering in the cellar below. There is also a chest right beneath the entrance. 
13:Try to fish out the chest using ropes and tools. 
14:Drop down some torches to keep the snakes away, then grab the chest before they attack. 
15:[Nature or Intellect] Figure out how to trick the snakes.
16:Just jump down and kill the snakes.
17:The rats lie dead and you are free to take the stash.
18:Gather the loot and leave.
19:The flute calms the snakes into submission, and you are free to take the chest hidden in the cellar.
20:Loot the chest and leave.
21:You kill all the vipers and now can take the chest hidden in the cellar.
22:You carefully place several burning torches so the snakes hide in the corners away from the chest, making it easy for you to take it. 
23:You try to scare the snakes with fire, but they are angry enough not to care. They swarm you like crazy and force you to retreat!
24:Run away.
25:The snakes prove too vicious. They swarm you like crazy and force you to retreat!{}{}
26:Most of this old inn has rotted away, but you find a secret hidey-hole behind the kitchen stove.{}{}{}{}You see something stashed within, but you also see a pack of rats sleeping on top. {}{} 
27:You know how to deal with rats. Take out your flute and charm them.
28:Figure out where best to lay traps for the rats.
29:[Witch]Take out a few smelly herbs, burn them, and enchant the rats to your servitude. 
30:You get the chest out safe and sound. 
31:Take the goods and leave.
32:You jump down and try to take the chest, but it's rotten and falls apart in your hands, revealing only dust inside. {}{}{}{}The angry snakes snap at you as you climb back up. {}{}
33:You break the door open and see a dark cellar beneath. You also realise the floor is slithering with a swarm of angry vipers. {}{}{}{}You spot a chest tucked away in the corner.
34:You know how to deal with snakes. Take out your flute and charm them.
35:Through nature of intellect, figure out how to trick the snakes.
36:You enchant the rats, and one of them wants to stay with you!{}{}{}{}You also get the stash.
37:You enchant the rats, and they stay away as you take the stash.
38:The rats go into a frenzy and another swarm joins them from a tunnel. You are forced to flee!
39:The flute calms the rats into submission, and you are free to take the chest hidden in the cellar.
40:You come across a secluded old hut that has seen better days. {}{}{}{}The doors are ajar and rattling in the wind, and cobwebs and shrubbery have covered most walls.
41:You sense a presence in the house. Observe it carefully for more signs.
42:The presence is faint, fleeting, but you sense a lot of anger and confusion. {}{}{}{}This will likely be a spirit. 
43:Go inside.
44:As soon as you step into the house, the doors and shutters slam shut, leaving you in darkness. {}{}{}{}A creaking noise comes from above.{}{}{}{}As you light your torches, you see a ladder leading up to a small landing.
45:Consider what type of spirit presence you're dealing with.
46:Try to break out of here.
47:This house is clearly haunted. You can try to cleanse it by facing the spirits on their ground, but this ritual may be dangerous.{}{}{}{}You can also attempt to find whatever binds the ghost to this place and destroy it. Of course, you could just try to force your way out, too.
48:[Goblin shaman or ghost]Enter the greyworld and defeat the angered spirit there. 
49:Perform the ritual and face the spirits. 
50:Look for whatever holds the spirit in this house.
51:Try to break out by force.
52:As you try to find a way out, you discover a cellar and run in, hoping to find another exit. Instead, you hear voices and see flickers of spiritual presence:{}{}{}{}'Stay, stay with us, play with us, we are lonely...'
53:Run back up and try to force your way out!
54:You try to break the doors, then the shutters, but they seem indestructible. With your every blow, the house creaks louder and inanimate objects begin to levitate and hit you!{}{}{}{}Pots, pans, chairs, and bones of the dead all fly at you like crazy!{}{}{}{}But you finally see a crack in the wooden structure.
55:Keep hitting it!
56:You begin your search. The creaking gets louder and more menacing with every step. It now sounds like a rocking chair. {}{}{}{}A few times, you swear you see a figure clad in a black dress. {}{}{}{}On the bottom floor, by the doors and shutters, you find the remains of some poor souls who were trying to get out. {}{}
57:Go up the ladder.
58:The dark spirit is defeated, and the house becomes just another old wreck.
59:Gather what you can and leave.
60:Your efforts to defeat this cursed house proved futile. Whatever you tried kept failing, and you felt like you had been stuck here for weeks. Finally, you feel smoke. You start choking badly, and you feel your spirit assaulted as you see that the house is on fire. You hear:{}{}{}{}'Burn, burn, you cursed house!'{}{}{}{}In a moment of clarity, you are able to run out. Whoever burned the house saved your skins, but they did not stay to take the praise.
61:You finally break the shutters open and run out, but some of the flying objects follow you and hit you hard. Worse, the spirit presence leaves a deep mark on your souls.
62:You push through the resistance and destroy the rocking chair by flame. {}{}{}{}The house exhales with a deep breath of fresh air, and the shutters and doors open.{}{}{}{}You find several more bodies of less-fortunate visitors. 
63:Bury the bodies and gather their belongings.
64:You finally break the shutters open and run out. Some of the flying objects follow you, but they collapse once outside. {}{}
65:Gather the objects and leave this place.
66:In the dim light of your torch, you see a wooden rocking chair, moving on its own. {}{}{}{}The air here is cold and heavy. {}{}{}{}The menacing presence you felt throughout the house is much stronger here. It is pushing you away from the chair. 
67:Stand firm and try to destroy the chair!
68:You kill the spirits and discover a way out through the cellar. {}{}{}{}You find a stash of goods abandoned here by someone who also tried to escape. From the bloodstains, you don't think they made it.{}{}
69:Take the stash and leave this place.
70:You find an old house overgrown with greenery. 
71:Go in carefully.
72:Check for tracks before going in.
73:Get through the shrubbery.
74:As you try to get through the shrubbery and vines, you are stung by a poison plant.{}{}{}{}But the way in is clear now.{}{}
75:There are no tracks to suggest that anyone came in or out in a long time. You also spot some poisonous vines on the house, so you must be careful making your way in.
76:Go in, carefully.
77:You enter a nicely kept family house. There's a stove, table, bedding up on a ledge, pottery, and hay on the floor - all kept tidy and liveable, yet with no people in sight.
78:Search the house.
79:As you rummage through the house, you spot a small, fatty creature with a bushy beard, large, dark eyes, and disproportionately long arms holding a tiny broom. {}{}{}{}It glares at you disapprovingly.
80:Chase it away.
81:Kill it.
82:Try talking to it.
83:Observe it to determine what sort of demon it may be.
84:You determine that it is a domovnik, a house demon charged with protecting its chosen abode. {}{}{}{}This one is clearly taking its duty above and beyond. {}{}{}{}Perhaps offering it food may snap it out of its current state.
85:Give it food. 
86:Talk to it.
87:You chase the creature away and gather up whatever useful stuff is left here.
88:The creature runs away from you, but it leaves behind a nauseating stench that makes you sick. {}{}{}{}Still, the house has some useful stuff to take.{}{}
89:You kill the creature, but just as it dies the whole house collapses on your heads!
90:'You make mess, you make so much mess! Masters will be back, they'll be back...'{}{}{}{}It keeps repeating itself over and over. You fear its little mind is gone. 
91:Clean what you messed up.
92:Try to convince it that the master is long gone.
93:You clean up after yourselves and leave quietly. {}{}{}{}After leaving, you find a small package in your backpack.
94:Within what seems like the remnants of a kitchen, with an old stone stove at its centre, you see broken pots and pans, a long-rotten pantry, and the skeletal remains of several humanoids that clearly died trapped here.
95:Scout the room to make sure it is safe.
96:Go in closer to see if the remains hold anything valuable. 
97:In the darkest corner of the chamber lurks a creature, its big, round eyes glimmering in the dark. You spot one of its legs with shaggy hair and long crooked claws. You also hear a quiet purr.{}{}{}{}It is clearly watching you. 
98:As a wise one, you know many creatures. Try to figure out what this is.
99:Try to keep out of its way as you loot. You don't want to have to kill it, but you also need resources.
100:Just leave. 
101:The more you look at the creature, the more you think it is a simple mrucek -- a harmless house demon, gone feral after being trapped here with its dead masters.
102:[Common demon]Try talking to it to show that you mean it no harm and it is now safe to leave.
103:[Magic user] Perform a ritual to ease this demon's disturbed soul. 
104:There is a loud purr and a rugged catlike creature pounces on you, claws and teeth first. {}{}{}{}You shake it off and it scampers away, leaving you with a few deep cuts and a curse.{}{}
105:Gather anything useful and leave.
106:You calm the mrucek so well that its body visibly changes, and it now resembles a common cat that will follow you faithfully. {}{}
107:Great. Gather anything useful and leave.
108:You calm the mrucek so well that its body visibly changes, and it now resembles a common cat, only fluffier and fatter. {}{}{}{}It purrs and disappears through the entrance you made.{}{}{}{}You feel a blessing upon you.
109:The mrucek purrs even louder and pounces on you, claws and teeth first. {}{}{}{}You shake it off and it scampers away, leaving you with a few deep cuts and a curse.{}{}
110:The creature trembles at your words. Its eyes fill with tears and it falls into uncontrollable despair. Within minutes, it lies dead.{}{}{}{}The room suddenly feels uneasy and unwelcoming, and its contents begin to rot away.
111:Quickly salvage what you can and leave.
112:The creature trembles at your words. Its eyes fill with tears and it bursts into uncontrollable laughter.{}{}{}{}The creature is as mad as they get, so leave it be. {}{}{}{}On your way out, you discover a package left in your backpack. 
113:The creature accepts the food and, true to its demon obligations, it is released from its former duties. {}{}{}{}It smiles at you and disappears, and the house begins to rot away before your eyes. On your way out, you discover a package left in your backpack. 
114:The domovnik takes your food and eats it, then chokes and dies!{}{}{}{}The room suddenly feels uneasy and unwelcoming, and its contents begin to rot away.
115:The domovnik takes your food and scuttles away to prepare the meal for its masters.{}{}{}{}It is clearly mad beyond help.{}{}{}{}But it lets you take what you need from the house. 
116:You come across an old hut in the woods. At first it seems quite run down, but you spot smoke coming from the chimney. 
117:Call out and see if anyone's home.
118:Sneak up to investigate.
119:As you approach the house, a set of chimes rings out. It sounds like they are made of silver. {}{}{}{}'Ha! You night demons can stay well away from my house! Hear me!'
120:[Witch]Compliment the house owner on good warding charms. 
121:Remark that the silver and charms only weaken you, and you could still go in if you wanted to. But you don't wish her any harm. You only want to talk.
122:Storm in and kill her!
123:Inside the hut you see an old woman hunched over the stove. The room has many dried herbs, strange liquids in vials, wishbones, chicken feet, and all sorts of similar ingredients.
124:It's a witch. Kill her.
125:[Witch]Go in to talk, but warn her not to try any funny business.
126:Knock on the door.
127:An old hooded woman answers the door and gestures for you to enter. She then returns to her rocking chair, sits, and says:{}{}{}{}'Come in, come in, strangers. May I offer you hot food? Sweets? Or perhaps some trade?'{}{}
128:Go in and speak to her.
129:You surprise the old hag and kill her swiftly. Alas, as she dies, she utters a curse on you!{}{}
130:Plunder the house and leave.
131:You surprise the old hag and kill her swiftly. She tries to curse you before she dies, but you're fast enough to stop her. {}{}
132:'I can make a brew with a good kick to it, if you like. Of course, there'll be a price.'
133:Ask for blessing of the body. [Trade 5 quartz]
134:Ask for blessing of the mind. [Trade 5 topaz]
135:Ask for blessing of the soul. [Trade 5 shadow bone]
136:[Magic or Magic User] State your domain of magic or your affinity to the mystical arts, and ask if she would be kind enough to teach you. 
137:Offer her food supplies in exchange for some of her wisdom.
138:Ask if you can trade.
139:The old hag tells you many wise tales. She finishes by saying:{}{}{}{}'And so, if you ever see a pretty lass by the water or think you hear a lovely song at the sea, pray heed my words and pinch yourself three times in the left butt cheek before you go do something silly with one of those seductress demons.'
140:Thank her for the advice and leave.
141:You hand over the goods, and the hag pricks you with a crude curved dagger. {}{}{}{}She then spits into the blood, picks one of her warts, throws it in and eats the slimy concoction. {}{}{}{}She then throws up violently all over you, and although you are utterly sick, you do feel the effects of the promised blessing.
142:Thank her and take your leave.
143:You hand over the goods, and the hag pricks you with a crude curved dagger. {}{}{}{}She splatters the blood over a dead rabbit, adds sweat from under her armpit, and spits three times over her right shoulder. {}{}{}{}She then hits you with the rabbit carcass repeatedly, and surprisingly, you begin to feel the desired effect.
144:You hand over the goods, and the hag pricks you with a crude curved dagger. {}{}{}{}You await the rest of the ritual, but she just laughs:{}{}{}{}'What, you thought I'd do something weird and nasty? It's all done. The blood did the trick. Till next time.'
145:The old hag tells you many fun tales. She finishes with:{}{}{}{}'So now you know, in life, the most precious things are hot water, good teeth, and a soft pillow for your old arse to sit on.'{}{}{}{}Somehow, you do not feel any wiser for it.{}{}
146:Kill her!
147:'Hmm, in the old days I did follow the master, Veles, so I will honour his progeny for tonight. {}{}{}{}Sit, drink, and listen.'{}{}{}{}The old hag tells you many stories before she finally says it is time to go. 
148:'Ha! Good one. Well met, sister. Now, for strangers I'd play a game of deals and trades and trickery. {}{}{}{}But for you I offer an honest trade between sisters, or I can teach ya some rituals and give ya some herbs, but I'd need some of your spirit energy in exchange.
149:Trade.
150:Learn some rituals.  
151:Thank her for now and leave.
152:You cut your hand, splatter the blood on the cleared ground, and throw three bones each from an unborn child's left hand. {}{}{}{}But the bones do not fall into a pattern, and the voice laughs at you:{}{}'Cheap tricks don't impress me. Go away!'{}{}
153:'Bugger off, then. You have no business here.'
154:'If you are what I think you are, prove it.'
155:Perform a simple bone-reading ritual. 
156:You cut your hand, splatter the blood on the cleared ground, and throw three bones each from an unborn child's left hand. {}{}{}{}The bones fall into a pattern.
157:Tell the woman that a dark handsome stranger will come to her door soon.
158:The witch defeats you and lays a curse upon your souls.
159:'Well, we traded. Now it's time to leave.'
160:'Nice tradin' with ya. Bye.'{}{}
161:Ask for blessing of the body. [Lose 5 quartz]
162:Ask for blessing of the mind. [Lose 5 topaz]
163:Ask for blessing of the soul. [Lose 5 shadow bone]
164:You find an old hut, perhaps a hunting lodge, that has been long abandoned and become overgrown with shrubbery and a tree growing out of its back wall.
165:Search it.
166:As soon as you step across the threshold, the rotten floorboards break, and you fall down a dark hole.{}{}{}{}As you fall, sticky spiderwebs soften your landing, but as you crash onto a soft, gooey surface, you realise you just crashed into spider eggs, and many red, angry eyes are approaching quickly!
167:Try to climb back up!
168:[Domain]Inspired by your domain, try to find a quick way to deal with the spiders without a fight.
169:The spiders are dead, but more might be coming.{}{}{}{}You find the remains of other victims caught in the webs.
170:Gather what you can and climb back up.
171:The spiders overwhelm you and force you to flee.{}{}
172:You climb up quickly and use a large stone to cover the hole before the spiders can follow.{}{}{}{}In the hut you find very little of use, but the adrenaline of the escape leaves you feeling invigorated.{}{}
173:You manage to climb up, but the spiders sting you a few times before you get away. {}{}
174:You light your torches to burn the webs and direct the smoke deeper into the tunnel towards the spiders.{}{}{}{}The spiders keep away from you, but more might be coming.{}{}{}{}You find the remains of other victims caught in the webs.
175:You try to think of something fast, but the spiders are faster. They swarm you angrily, and all you can do is climb up to safety as quickly as possible. {}{}
176:Run.{}{}
177:You look through the desolate hut but find nothing of use except a large crow's nest sitting up on what used to be the chimney. {}{}{}{}Giant crows are dangerous, but they are known to collect trophies of their victims in their nest.
178:Climb up and try to loot the nest before the occupant returns.
179:The roof and old chimney are rickety. Shake the nest down.
180:Giant crows are dangerous. Leave.
181:[Crow]Fly up and loot the nest. 
182:You climb up and reach for a stash of goods just as a loud screech deafens you and you see black feathers and talons nosediving towards you!
183:Fight!
184:You climb up and reach for a stash of goods before the owner comes back.
185:You shake the nest down without trouble, but just as you are about to loot it, a loud screech deafens you and you see black feathers and talons nosediving towards you!
186:You shake the nest down without trouble and find a stash of goods hidden among the now-dead baby crows. 
187:Contemplate the senseless death of baby crows. 
188:Gather the stash and leave.
189:You feel the destruction of the nest was not in line with nature or the path of harmony. {}{}
190:Gather the loot in shame and leave.
191:You walk in on a group of ruffians enjoying a nice hunk of humanoid leg by the fire. {}{}{}{}Their hungry eyes fall on you and they rise, weapons raised. {}{}
192:[Night demons]Compliment their meal choice and ask if they have anything to trade.
193:[Unliving]Point out that you have no nutritional value and ask to be excused from the table.
194:The turmoil inside you was fuming for a fight, so you feel weakened by this escape. {}{}
195:You kill the ruffians and find they did not carry much on them. Still, you did end their cannibal ways.
196:The ruffians beat you badly. You have to drop your food to stop them from running after you!{}{}
197:You fly up and reach for a stash of goods before the owner comes back.
198:The crows beat you and chase you away from their nest.
199:They look at you knowingly and nod. One comes up with a bloodied pack of goods to trade.
200:Trade. 
201:Thank them for the offer, but leave.
202:Pretend to leave, then perform a tactical attack. 
203:They look at you, scowl, and nod. 
204:You find a small abandoned house. Most of it has collapsed. {}{}{}{}You see signs that someone tried to move the debris to get to something, but their efforts failed.
205:Move the debris yourself.
206:You manage to move the debris and find an old cellar. Perhaps this was once a bandit hideout, as it looks like it contains stashed loot. {}{}{}{}Much of the equipment has rotted away, but some is salvageable.
207:You manage to move the debris and find several dead bodies -- likely bandits, as they are armed.{}{}{}{}Much of the equipment has rotted away, but some is salvageable.
208:You manage to move the debris and find an old cellar. Perhaps this was once a hunter's lodge, as you find many trophies and leathers.{}{}{}{}Much of the equipment has rotted away, but some is salvageable.
209:The debris is too heavy, and it is likely that whatever may have been hidden beneath it has been crushed. 
210:Don't give up. Push yourselves to clear this!
211:You are dead tired, bruised, and hungry, but you finally clear the debris. {}{}{}{}Underneath you find a few dead bodies. 
212:Bury them and take their stuff. 
213:You are dead tired, bruised, and hungry, but you finally clear the debris. {}{}{}{}Underneath you find absolutely nothing but the wood you shuffled.
214:You find the old ruins where the orcs sent you to deal with some dwarves.{}{}{}{}You see signs of humanoid presence, but no dwarves yet.
215:[Hunter or perception]Track the earth diggers.
216:Search the place.
217:Come back later.
218:You track the dwarves and find them working on an entrance to an underground structure. They have not spotted you.
219:Surround the dwarves and make your presence known.
220:You have the advantage, attack!
221:You are ambushed by the dwarves!
222:Try to run away.
223:You search the place and finally spot some dwarves. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
224:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to tell them they need to leave. The orcs do not want them here, and they are coming in force!
225:Try to look intimidating and tell them to leave, now.
226:[Dwarf]Ask what they are doing here, so deep into orc territory.
227:You are badly beaten and the orcs have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.'
228:'Ah, laddie, it is a tough nugget. We learnt that an old anvil from a renowned smith lies buried here. It is an heirloom, as ya know. We must get it out before those skunks get their green hands on it. Will ya help?'
229:[Crafter or tools]Offer them help.
230:Say that you will help them to make it faster so they can avoid the orcs.
231:Insist that they depart now if they value their lives.
232:You stay for some time and help the dwarves recover the anvil. {}{}{}{}'Stone and metal yer made of, laddies! Our thanks to you. Here, take this and tell those rugged friends of yers that we're gone. And be careful befriendin' their sort -- turmoil runs in their dark veins, that it does!'
233:Nod and wish them well. 
234:'You lassies just skip along and play with yer green fellas. Us here, we got a job to do, and we'll serve up a good beatin' to anyone who interferes.'
235:Leave them be.
236:They jump to their feet. You see a couple of burly dwarf fighters stand in your way, weapons at the ready.{}{}{}{}'Oi, you! Beat it, this is our find.'
237:Convince the dwarves that they are outnumbered. A large pack of orc bloodtrackers are already on their way here, so they'd best leave now.
238:'Bah, neither you nor those fools will get this open anyways. We go now, lassie, but we'll be back to whoop ya and yer orc mates well and good!'{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased when they see the dwarves 'running away,' although they say they'd rather see them in the dirt. You get a reward for a job well done.
239:Thank them and leave.
240:The orcs don't realize that you helped the dwarves, so they are pleased that you got rid of them. However, they complain that there are no dwarven bodies, which means you did not choose the warrior's path. Still, they leave you a payment.
241:The dwarves are grateful for your help. They stay to recover the anvil, which may take some time.{}{}
242:The orcs are not happy with your results. They send their own forces to kill the dwarves, and they tell you not to offer help when you do not mean it.
243:The orcs are not overjoyed with your 'solution,' but in the end, they stick to your promises and let the dwarves get the anvil.{}{}{}{}'You made an oath while acting for us, and we will not break it. But you are cowards! We will pay you for the job, but we do not make friends with talkers.'
244:When you inform the orcs of your failure, they are disappointed in your efforts. 
245:You kill the dwarves.{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
246:[Orc]Show them what those skunk green hands can do. Attack!
247:The alpha clan sent you to get a wolf pack, and you track down the cave where it sleeps. 
248:You know how to handle wolves. Try to figure it out.
249:[Hunter]Track the wolves.
250:[Nature]Try to reach the wolves' inner spirit to calm them in the name of nature. 
251:[Striga master or mistress]You sense a minion of the night here. Call out to them, and make them heed your command!
252:Use meat to try to lure some young pups to the orc village.
253:You observe the pack and quickly notice they are not mere wolves. They act with irregularities known only to humans -- all, or at least some, here are werewolves.
254:[Werewolf]Run with the pack, speak to the alpha, and see if he'll send some of his wolves to serve the orcs.
255:Speak to the alpha werewolf, and convince him that his small pack will be served best if he lets some wolves go to the orcs.
256:[Night demon or strength]Try to claim this territory for yourself. Perhaps they will back away if they judge you to be stronger.
257:You observe the pack and quickly notice they are not mere wolves. They act with irregularities known only to humans -- all, or at least some, here are werewolves.{}{}{}{}You can try to set traps to capture some wolves, but if the werewolves catch you, it may prove lethal.
258:Trap the wolves.
259:Just kill them the old-fashioned way.
260:You run with the pack and speak of the orc clans. The alpha agrees to give it a try and send some of his wolves to serve the alpha clans.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed with your results -- an alliance with a werewolf pack is a great boon for them. They honour you and leave gifts.{}{}
261:The werewolves bow to your dominance and leave, and you manage to get a few young wolves for the orcs.{}{} {}{}The alpha clan is happy with your work.{}{} 
262:You manage to get several young pups for the orcs and trap a few adults too. Luckily for you, only the adult wolves bite back a bit.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed with your competence.
263:You give the meat away and lead the animals to the orc village. 
264:Good.
265:You lure some pups to the village, but you soon realise they are no mere wolves but werewolves. The pack attacks the orcs to take back their young. {}{}{}{}The orcs enjoyed the challenge of the fight, but they are unimpressed with your poor knowledge. 
266:You lure some pups to the orc village and the alpha clan is happy with your work, although they say that you chose the cowardly way.{}{}
267:You slay the wolves, but enough pups survive to take back to the orcs.{}{}{}{}The alpha clan laughs, saying they had bet on whether you'd find out they were werewolves in time, but they are pleased with both the pups and your warrior ways.
268:You are defeated and eventually the folk who asked for your help deal with the problem themselves, so you do not gain any friendship.
269:'Argh, words, human words. We are free, we stay free!'{}{}{}{}The pack starts to circle your position.
270:Give up.
271:Your scheming fails. You are assailed by the werewolves and the orcs have to save your skin. They laugh at your failure.
272:'There is wisdom in growing the pack.'{}{}{}{}The alpha werewolf howls in agreement and vows to take some young wolves to serve with the orcs. {}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed with your results - an alliance with a werewolf pack is a great boon for them. They honour you and leave gifts.
273:The orcs laugh at your incompetence and you lose their respect. 
274:You run with the pack and tell them about the orcs, but in turn they tell you of their freedom and lust for life. You hear their call and before you know it, you take part in a hunt for the alpha clans. {}{}{}{}The orcs cherish the challenge you brought and praise your iron will, so you still gain some of their friendship.{}{}
275:A werewolf alpha answers the call and bows down to your command and kinship. The pack sends some wolves with you to serve the orcs.{}{}{}{}The alpha clan is happy with your work.{}{}
276:You slay the pack, and there aren't any good wolves left to take back to the orcs. {}{}{}{}The alpha clan laughs at your incompetence as beast masters, but they value your warrior spirit. You gain a little friendship.
277:Just as you depart, one of the werewolves howls and whispers your way: {}{}{}{}'One of you is of our blood, and now that you hear my call, you shall awaken. {}{}{}{}If you wish, come seek us, pup. If not, good hunting to you.'
278:You manage to get several young pups for the orcs and trap a few adults too, but the werewolves catch on to what you are doing, and you barely escape their full wrath.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed with your competence.
279:The trader's stalls stand open for you. {}{}
280:Come back another time.
281:'You are no friends of ours, so we won't take food as payment and you'll have to pay us extra first.'
282:'Good trading. Now go, fight your enemies!'
283:'You are no friends of ours, so you'll have to pay us extra first.'
284:'If you value your skins, speak fast, or die faster! Why are you here?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}This village is small, as such, it will not offer recruitment and may have other options limited.
285:Ask if there is anything you can help with.
286:Say you just came to rest and visit, perhaps heal your wounds.
287:Ask if you can buy some wolves.
288:'You're no friends of ours, so you'd best move along or you will taste our blades.'{}{}{}{}You see armed orcs gathering.
289:Stand firm and say that you wish to prove your worth by showing your physical prowess.
290:The village lies destroyed, and the spoils are yours.
291:'Some of our folk have gone missing, and we think a pack of wolves may have become too arrogant. We'd send our bloodtrackers, obviously, but since you want to play for us, maybe you should go.'
292:Agree.
293:Decline and leave.
294:'Come, sit by the fires, train with us, or see the medicine woman if you dare! There are also men who will serve your needs, if you like?'
295:Pay to get physical wounds healed. 
296:Pay to get mental wounds healed. 
297:Pay to have poison removed.
298:Ask if there's an orc witch who can heal spiritual ailments.
299:A bloodtracker is demonstrating their prowess. Join them, and perhaps you can learn a trick or two.
300:Come back another day.
301:'There is a small lava pit not too far. Many of our warrior women went to pay respects to the fires, but none returned. We've got a lot of trouble setting up this small settlement, so if you really want to help, go see where our warriors went.'
302:'You want to prove yourselves? Good. Do it!'
303:Ask if anything needs killing.
304:You have a lot of wood on you. Ask if they need some.
305:You see that they are in need of metal. Tell them you're willing to give away some of yours.
306:There is nothing to do here for now. Come back another day.
307:'Some pointy ears are hanging around our woods, and we want them gone. You prove yourself to us that way.'
308:'I can take the darkness away from you, but you must pay. Magic comes at a price. Healing the spirit is easier, but curses, well, they are nasty things, and they'll cost you more -- it will cost you blood. Oh, and I do not heal males.'
309:[Witch]Say that you only need your sister's aid. You'll pay the price yourself and promise not to burden her. 
310:Agree to pay the price to remove curses.
311:Ask to have your spirit wounds healed.
312:[Orc]Ask her for the traditional orc spirit healing for both curses and spirit wounds.
313:The witch says, 'Bah, should've said so, sister. I wouldn't have tried to sell you the price crap, ha. Let's get to it.'{}{}{}{}Together, you remove any curses you had and you heal the spirit.{}{}
314:Thank her and leave.
315:'You give us your goods, recognising our superiority, good!{}{}We can spare some of our scraps for you.'
316:Wish them well and leave.
317:'We have some good wolves, but be sure you can tame them -- they are no pets. They are beasts that may become your companion!'
318:Buy a wolf. 
319:'Yeah, we do have a task for your type. Go to the old ruins, where we used to live, before the Shattering broke it all. Dig up an iron idol. It's important to us, but we haven't had time to go ourselves. Prove yourself.'
320:'Ha! You sure are tough bastards. Fine, come along, but we're watching you!'
321:Ask to trade.
322:Offer to do something for them to prove your goodwill.
323:'You are weaklings, not worth our time. Go!'
324:'You walk an odd path, but I suppose you are of our blood, so yes, I will heal your spirit with flame that would kill the others.{}{}{}{}Your friends can still pay me if they need healing.'{}{}
325:'Either we do not have any work for you, or you or your kin are already set on a path to aid us. Finish that path before you ask for new tasks.'
326:'Feeling sad, are we? Come, I will make you forget sadness!'{}{}{}{}A huge orc woman approaches you with an iron rod.
327:Perhaps not. Leave.
328:'Halt? Oh, you, you may enter.'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}Once you become friends, you will get the chance to recruit.
329:Say that you know orcs have the best wolf packs, and ask if you can buy one.
330:Ask to go watch the fighting pits for the chance to recruit. 
331:See if you  can have your pet trained here.
332:You see a familiar face, approach.
333:'Dwarves seem to think they can dig wherever they like, as if all the earth is theirs. Tell them to beat it before we take the time to go say it ourselves!'
334:Ask if there's a witch orc who can heal spiritual ailments.
335:[Female]Say you would like those manly services they mentioned.
336:[Male]Say you would like those manly services they mentioned.
337:'Some force defiled our funeral pyres. Orc bones rose from the ash and cannot settle. You will prove your honour if you deal with them.'
338:Are there any places of interest around here?
339:'There are some clan-less orcs not too far from here - stubborn lot, won't leave. You make them go, yes? They are . . . a problem for me. Perhaps outsider presence will help matters.'
340:'I can take the darkness away from you, but you must pay. Magic comes at a price. Healing the spirit is easier, but curses, well, they are nasty things, and they'll cost you more - it will cost you blood. Oh, and I do not heal males.'
341:'We have some good wolves, but be sure you can tame them - they are no pets. They are beasts that may become your companion!'
342:'Goblin scum set up camp nearby. Looks like they mean to stay. We don't appreciate this. You want to prove yourselves to us, you go and kill them!'
343:'You are weaklings, do not waste our time. Leave!'
344:'You proved yourselves and we can't search it all. Sure, there are some places worth your metal. Go knock yourselves out.'
345:Nod in agreement.
346:'Some demon scum are causing trouble. You want to prove your worth, you go deal with them.'
347:Several orc males come parading their muscles for your admiration. When they see you are male, they hesitate, but the females gesture for them to obey.{}{}{}{}They shrug as if to say 'Whatever' and the lucky one allows himself to be taken by the hair into the tent. {}{}{}{}Steaming sex is not just a metaphor for orcs, as you make love atop a bed of hot coals!
348:Wish them well and depart.
349:Several orc males come parading their muscles for your admiration, and the lucky one allows themselves to be taken by the hair into the tent. {}{}{}{}Steaming sex is not just a metaphor for orcs, as you make love atop a bed of hot coals!
350:You go searching for pet trainers.
351:See the bloodtrackers, they train with wolves and more.
352:Go see a witch to train familiars.
353:You find the place where you were sent to deal with banished orcs that are making trouble for the alpha clan, but for some reason the alphas don't want to deal with it themselves.
354:[Orc or bandit]You know how to deal with ruffians -- you dabbled in such a life too. Speak to them. 
355:[Turmoil]Shout at the orcs and shake them into action. Say that they have been sitting here, clan-less and bored, like scholars. They need to move on, fight, challenge the world!
356:Bribe the orcs to leave.
357:[Orc matriarch]Order them to heel before your authority!
358:Go speak to them, and ask why they will not leave these lands if they are banished.
359:[Harmony]Convince the banished orcs that it is wiser to leave than to face you or later face the other orcs too.
360:You come to the banished camp and spot several orcs. They look thin and tired, so there may be room for negotiation, although it is never certain with those so filled with turmoil.
361:[Orc]Convince your kin that they need to seek out challenges and bring home blood trophies to regain honour, not sit here and cry like babes!
362:[Bandit or orc]Convince your kin that they need to seek out challenges and bring home blood trophies to regain honour, not sit here and cry like babes!
363:[Bandit]Barter with them. Explain that their days of a senseless, honour-bound life are gone, so it's time to think of the next good meal and proper challenge. Perhaps you can pay them to go and seek adrenaline elsewhere.
364:You still have the element of surprise, attack!
365:'Yes, yes! You are right, we are worthless scum, we must go and fight! For honour!'{}{}{}{}The alpha clan is impressed with your swift resolution. {}{}
366:'Yes, yes! You are right, we are worthless scum, we must go and fight! For honour!'{}{}{}{}The alpha clan is not known to favour peaceful resolution, but this time, they seem very happy with your result and they reward you well.
367:'Taking goods from a clan-less lot -- never thought that day would come. But my men are starving, and the alpha clan is keeping us away from resources. It is time to move.'
368:You are about to report your success when you learn that the clan-less orcs attacked the alpha clan in a desperate attempt for a glorious death.{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased with how it ended, the problem gone and their brethren dead with honour. They reward you well.
369:The clan-less orcs leave, their honour soiled even more. {}{}{}{}The alpha clan seems saddened by this, and they do not respect your bribery, but they give you a reward for a job done.{}{}
370:You kill the orcs and report back, but the alpha clan is angered:{}{}{}{}'If we wanted to kill 'em, we'd go and kill 'em ourselves! Bah. I suppose it is hard to resist the blood call, but of all the times to be like us . . .'{}{}{}{}They leave you a reward, but your friendship doesn't grow much.
371:You are beaten and the orcs laugh at your honourless defeat.
372:'Ha ha, good try, pups, good try. Tell your bitch matriarch she has to try harder though, because we ain't moved by silver tongues.'
373:Pay them off.
374:Ask them why they will not leave these lands if they are banished.
375:'Yes, yes! You are right, we are worthless scum, we must go and fight. For honour!'{}{}{}{}The alpha clan is not known to favour peaceful resolution, but this time, they seem very happy with your result and they reward you well.{}{}
376:The alpha clan heard of your cowardice and laughs at your puny gods. 
377:'Bah, shut your trap, you turncoat! We'll practise our blades on your traitor skin!'{}{}{}{}The orcs attack. 
378:Fight.
379:'Deal's a deal. Solid trading with you.'{}{}{}{}They move on and the orcs are content with your approach.{}{}
380:'Eh, maybe you are right. It is time to stop the games and claim our turf as bandits. So you pay us to go, and we even trade with you as well, how's that for honour amongst thieves, eh?'
381:Agree to trade and pay.
382:Refuse.
383:'We do not fear you, nor the so-called honoured orcs! We stay.'
384:Just attack them.
385:'Ha, sending an inferior matriarch to deal with me, shameless bitch! You taste our blades and tell her the flavour!'{}{}{}{}They attack with greater ferocity! 
386:An orc matriarch turns your way. She is old, which is not something you see often amongst the orc clans:{}{}{}{}'We stay because we choose to. The young pups can come and ask themselves. We are heroes of the blood-times. We were cast out for breaking clan rules, yet our names remain carved in blood and sweat as honourable. The pups do not know what to do about that, ha!'
387:[Orc]Why doesn't the alpha clan ask for an honour fight? Surely that would settle the matter well enough.
388:Say that you imagined orcs would have some bloody way to deal with this themselves. Surely she isn't that scary for a whole clan?
389:'Would it, though? The young Walker in Blood, the alpha matriarch, she is wise, you see. If her woman fails an honour fight to a clan-less old fart like me, ha ha. {}{}{}{}She could risk sending a male, and then a defeat would be blamed on his balls, but sending an inferior challenger to face a hero? She could come herself -- she'd likely whoop my arse -- but then it is too much honour for me. Poor thing, ha ha!'
390:So why send you, then? Isn't it also a problem?
391:'Suppose it's an interesting choice. Clever bitch. You're outsiders, but you seek to gain her favour, yes? It is our custom to allow outsiders to prove themselves. So, if you win, good, she got rid of us and got herself a strong ally. If you lose, it is no skin off her back.'
392:In that case, demand that she stands against one of your challengers in an honour fight, and if you win, they have to leave!
393:Say that this whole thing seems rather honourless on her part. Sitting here, waiting, playing games with the honour of an alpha matriarch. Surely a hero would rather seek more glory and return triumphant?
394:Enough talk, attack them!
395:'Hardly, and yet yes. We would typically solve this by an honour fight. One on one, best blade wins.'
396:So that would solve the issue here, yes?
397:You open your mouth to speak, but one of the orcs spits at you:{}{}{}{}'I smell the stagnation of harmony on your breath! I thank you, for you have stirred my warrior blood from this rot. Now, you run or you die!'
398:'You offer us things to go away quietly, like some goblin scum? How dare you offend our honour! Die!'
399:You surrender, and the orcs laugh in your face:{}{}{}{}'Cowardly pups, this is what your puny gods have to offer? You die or you win -- no surrender!'
400:You surrender, and the orcs laugh in your face:{}{}{}{}'Cowardly pups, this will taint the alpha matriarch's precious honour, ha ha! Sending such spineless sods after me. Go, crawl away.'{}{}{}{}The alpha clan does not speak to you for a time. 
401:The orcs are beaten and the matriarch speaks with her last breath:{}{}{}{}'For blood and honour. Thank you for giving us death in battle. And because you did not challenge me properly, that alpha bitch doesn't get her best win. Ha!'{}{}{}{}She dies, and later the alpha matriarch takes the news with calm anger. You gain some respect for the win, but not as much as you could have with a proper challenge.{}{}
402:You defeat the matriarch and she kneels before you, bleeding and likely taking her last breath:{}{}{}{}'For blood and honour, you are the children of Zorza! I die well, and that young bitch may yet be a worthy matriarch if she sent you. Die with honour, friend.'{}{}{}{}The rest of the clan-less pay their respect to you and leave. The alpha clan is impressed with your deed and rewards you for it.{}{} 
403:'Well, there you go. Her honour is intact, she can shun you for bein' useless, and we stay. I wonder what she'll think of next. Blood and honour be with you -- you fought well.'{}{}{}{}The alpha clan does not speak to you for a time.
404:'No.'
405:'The wisdom of youth, or is it those gods of yours? We have become old farts sittin' here. Time to end the games. We move out, and we'll show those youngsters how heroes die!'{}{}{}{}They leave, and the alpha clan is unusually happy with this peaceful resolution.
406:You approach the lava pit where the orcs said their people keep disappearing.
407:[Hunter or perception]Check the tracks.
408:The lava pit seems normal at first, but you notice irregular movements, and then you realise there are many little red eyes watching you from the pit.
409:Keep your distance and try to find the missing orcs -- or their remains.
410:You are ambushed by lava rockers!
411:You search the place and the lava pit seems ordinary, but just as you are about to leave, you see a safe path form across the pit. In the centre, a magnificent blade held by a stone hand waits for you.
412:Go get the weapon!
413:Blindly attack the lava pit. Something is clearly here!
414:Leave and tell the orcs what you found.
415:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, and the orcs laugh at your cowardice.{}{}
416:'Orcs come, take challenge, lose. Now they be lava.'{}{}{}{}The troll shows a necklace of orc tusks.
417:[Runemaster]This reminds you of old dwarven traditions, where a rock or lava troll would be the guardian of a magnificent blade. And trolls get very obsessed with a given job. 
418:Thank the troll for the truth and go report it to the orcs.
419:Attack in revenge for the fallen!
420:The lava troll stares at you, then answers:{}{}{}{}'You master. I do job well. None got the weapon yet.'
421:Say that he's done the job well indeed. Now you have come to get the weapon.
422:'Orcs come, take challenge, lose. Now they be lava. Now you join?'{}{}{}{}The troll shows a necklace of orc tusks.
423:You circle the pit a few times, the red eyes still watchful. You see no sign of orcs. But you hear a voice booming from the lava:{}{}{}{}'You face me? You get the rewards?'{}{}{}{}You see a great weapon emerge from the fire, and a path forms, leading you into the centre of the pit.
424:Say that you are only here to find the missing orcs, and you do not wish to enter into any challenge.
425:[Orc]A challenge? Yes, accept it!
426:[Light]These creatures emanate the light of Svarog's forge. Ask them where the orcs are.
427:Ask what this challenge will be.
428:Accept the challenge.
429:[Wisdom]Go back and tell the orcs about this. Say that your honour forbade you to take the challenge, as it was made on their turf, and their own men clearly fell to it.
430:'Agreed. Now I go.'{}{}{}{}The troll sinks into the lava pit, and the red eyes follow him.{}{}{}{}The orcs are relieved that their kin died in combat, although they are quietly unhappy that you managed to best the beast. But they honour their deal and your friendship grows.
431:The orcs are glad to know what has befallen their comrades:{}{}{}{}'Died in battle, good! Guess it was too much to expect you folks to give that troll a whooping - we'll just go do it ourselves. Here, your reward.'
432:The orcs laugh at your surrender and call you cowardly. {}{}{}{}They are pleased that their brethren chose a fiery death over escape.
433:You kill the rockers and find the remains of orcs within the lava pit, as well as a dead lava troll. The last missing orc must have killed it but died also.{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased to know of their kin's heroic deeds and your revenge.
434:You speak of light and Svarog and a voice finally answers: {}{}{}{}'You smell of the forge fires. You solid. Orcs are fire too, they fail challenge, they honoured on my neck now. You do challenge, you get reward.{}{}{}{}And because you light, I no trap you. Choose now.'
435:Evoke your divine domain and demand that the troll gives you the weapon!
436:'You come, you see. Challenge?'
437:You enter the lava pit, and as you follow the path to the centre, it disappears behind you, leaving you encircled by fire. {}{}{}{}Many red eyes emerge from the fire - lava rockers and then their mama comes forth, her fiery neck covered with orc tusks.
438:Try to escape!
439:You turn back, but you're burned and the troll still stands before you!
440:The orc matriarch is impressed:{}{}{}{}'Yes, a wise choice indeed. It would look foul on my small clan if outsiders dealt with it when my own women could not. {}{}{}{}Here, a reward and my gratitude!'
441:The orcs laugh at your cowardice and say they will face whatever hides in the flames themselves.{}{}
442:You kill the rockers and the lava troll and find the remains of orcs within the lava pit, as well as a dead lava troll. The last missing orc must have killed it but died also.{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased to know of their kin's heroic deeds and your revenge.
443:You find the ruins where the orcs asked you to dig out a clan heirloom. 
444:[Dwarf or perception]Take a closer look.
445:Search for the right building.
446:You identify the building they asked you to dig into, and you notice several weak spots that will make your work easier. 
447:You have tools that will improve your chances here. Start digging.
448:Dig. 
449:[Orc]You spot a group of humans on your way here -- nomads. Go convince them to do this boring work, or your kin will never respect you!
450:As you search for the building, you are ambushed by bandits!
451:You find the building where you were told to dig. Some of it was stone built and seems to have collapsed due to a tremor. 
452:Dig.
453:You stink, your body aches, and some of you may have gotten a disease from the corrupted soil.{}{}{}{}The orcs laugh at your failure to perform this menial task.{}{}
454:You dig through several layers of rubble and dirt and realise that this building was likely some type of bath house or outhouse, although why it would be stone built, you do not know. {}{}{}{}The wood, stone, and earth all stink like hell and now so do you. But you do uncover a skeleton holding an iron idol. {}{}
455:Take it back to the orcs.
456:The nomads feel intimidated enough to do your bidding. {}{}{}{}When you return triumphant with the iron idol in hand, the orcs are impressed with you and reward you well.
457:The orcs laugh and mock you for doing such a menial task.{}{}{}{}'That old witch, she was an oddball, yeah. She built this really big shithouse 'cause she was scared of the bies coming for her, then the damned thing killed her when the earth shook. None of us was willin' to go dig it up on account of the shittiness, but thanks!'
458:When you inform the orcs of your failure, they laugh in your face and mock you.
459:You kill the bandits and find that they must have dug out the orc treasure, as you discover the iron clan idol you were asked to bring back.{}{}{}{}The orcs are strangely surprised by your valiant success. They say the gods must indeed light your path -- the path of the warrior. 
460:The nomads don't just laugh at you -- their archers pepper you with arrows and you are forced to flee the site.
461:Run.
462:You approach the graveyard where the alpha clan sent you to deal with some skeletons.
463:[Wisdom and hunter]The orc skeletons seem bound to a particular spot. Set some fire traps and burn those unliving orcs to cinders.
464:[Magic user]You know how to deal with an unliving scourge. Prepare a ritual.
465:[Unliving]No need to kill. Tell your unliving brethren to abandon the area.
466:[Turmoil]This is a battlefield of old. You can sense the turmoil soaked deep into the ground. Honour the fallen by battle!
467:Investigate this place.
468:[Skeleton]Go in alone and convince your kin to leave here.
469:You prepare a ritual that should disrupt the dark magic that animates these bones. This will make destroying them much easier. Now that they are wakened, you can face them in the spirit realm and thus completely destroy the dark magic.{}{}
470:Kill the ones that are left the old-fashioned way. Attack!
471:Destroy the dark source.
472:This challenge is too great. Abandon it.
473:You speak to your skeletal kin. They listen and take strength from your divine influence despite their life force being held by the dark magic that animates them. {}{}{}{}They are not awakened like you, but your words made them want to break free. You see them fighting an internal battle, and in the end, they win -- collapsing on the floor, lifeless and free again.
474:Inform the orcs.
475:You go in and speak to the unliving orcs, but they are not awakened like you. They follow some master's dark path and move towards you aggressively.
476:Try to get away.
477:You speak to your skeletal kin. They listen and take strength from your divine influence despite their life force being held by the dark magic that animates them. {}{}{}{}Your brethren beg you to come with them, to guide them away from the dark and onto a better path. They are not ready to join others and need you to leave with them.
478:Agree to take on the responsibility. [Lose one skeleton]
479:Do not allow your friend to leave! 
480:You set the traps and the orc skeletons burn to ash. {}{}{}{}The orcs thank you for freeing their fallen, and leave a reward.
481:The skeletons and their dark master lie dead, but his body dissolves into thick smoke before you can inspect it further.{}{}{}{}You also find a wraith, likely the product of whatever dark arts were performed here. It may want to stay with you.
482:Take the wraith.
483:Kill the wraith, as it's clearly an instrument of this evil!
484:The orc skeletons defeat your efforts and swarm you. The orcs have to come to your rescue and they are not impressed with your 'help.'
485:You are distraught at the decision, but you listen to your friends in this and say your farewells to the skeletons. {}{}{}{}They leave, but some already grumble that the old way was better and that they should find a necromancer to serve.
486:These unliving bones must have been away from their master for a long time. They listen to your commands as if they were yearning for someone to give one.{}{}{}{}They move away, but the orcs are displeased that you did not end their fallen's suffering.
487:You spot a wraith trapped here too, and it wants to attach itself to you.
488:These unliving bones must have been away from their master for a long time. They listen to your commands as if they were yearning for someone to give one.{}{}{}{}The orcs are not happy that you did not end their kin's unnatural state, but you did free them from bondage, and that is appreciated.
489:As you go in closer, you see the ruins of an old arena, and within it, several unliving corpses are fighting. A figure clad in black robes stands above them and watches intensely with one arm raised high above his head.
490:[Magic user or magic]Approach this odd menagerie and try to sense what magic is at work here.
491:[Orc or Turmoil]Something smells rotten here. Go in closer.
492:Abandon this task.
493:The unliving orcs beat you badly and force you to flee. The orcs have to come to your rescue and they are not impressed with your 'help.'
494:The alpha clan does not speak much of this event, especially of the necromancer, saying only that he never should have lived to become one.{}{}{}{}They thank you for getting rid of the scourge, and leave a reward.
495:Neither the man in the arena nor the orc skeletons react to you. Whatever this is, they are entirely enthralled. {}{}{}{}You sense strong turmoil magic here, and you think whatever this ritual is, it is clearly necromancy!
496:Attack now while he is busy.
497:[Orc witch or matriarch]This is no mere man -- it is an orc male, daring to practise necromancy! Charge at him.
498:Prepare a ritual to face these fiends in the spirit world!
499:You destroy the binding spell and the unliving orcs collapse in a pile of bones. {}{}{}{}The orcs thank you for freeing their fallen, and leave a reward.
500:You destroy the skeletons and burn the remains so they do not rise again.{}{}{}{}The orcs thank you for freeing their fallen, and leave a reward.
501:The wraith does not speak, but gestures that it will now serve you.
502:Take the wraith and leave.
503:'No!' The necromancer turns at the last minute, shouts a power word, and disappears, taken by dark tendrils into the shadows.{}{}{}{}The skeletons collapse, freed from his domain, and you burn them to make sure he cannot take control again.
504:The orc turns to you and tries to cast a spell to escape, but you get to him first.
505:Neither the man in the arena nor the orc skeletons react to you. Whatever this is, they are entirely enthralled. {}{}{}{}You sense strong turmoil magic here, and you think whatever this ritual is, it controls these skeletons.
506:You discover remnants of a ritual and sense an uneasy energy in the air, making you ill. {}{}{}{}You also find a wraith, likely the product of whatever dark arts were performed here. It seems to want to stay with you.
507:The orcs thank you for freeing their fallen, and leave a reward.
508:The orcs are not happy that you did not end their kin's unnatural state, but you did free them from bondage, and that is appreciated.
509:You find the remains of the skeletons.{}{}{}{}You also find a wraith, likely the product of whatever dark arts were performed here. It may want to stay with you.
510:You find the place where the orcs said elves are roaming. It is a small patch of woodland, but as soon as you enter, you feel an oddly calming energy.
511:You know forest folk. Go in and search for the elder kin.
512:[Rusalka or syrin]The elves have a soft spot for the arts. Sing them a song they cannot ignore and lead them away from this place.
513:[Nature or Harmony]Speak up and ask the elves to leave this place, as the orcish way of turmoil will surely bring conflict soon.
514:Ask if there is any price they would accept for leaving here in peace, as you do not wish to fight.
515:[Orc]Pansy elves thinking this is their land again. Attack them!
516:You find a small sapling of a silver oak tree, and you sense the elves are watching you approach.
517:[Elf]Say that you can see your kin are here to watch over the silver oak, but advise them to take the sapling and find safer grounds, because the orcs are brutes and will likely not leave them be.
518:[Forest demon]Tell your fellow wood folk that you can see they are here to care for this sapling, yet it is futile in such a small forest and with brutish orcs at the doorstep.
519:Your song is beautiful and entrancing. The elves indeed follow the tune out of the forest, although you are unsure how permanent this solution is.
520:Watch them leave.
521:'Yes, your words are wise indeed, and we shall heed them. Do be watchful with whom you make friends, though. One should not have to face one's own kin in struggle when the wrong side is chosen.' {}{}{}{}They bow and begin preparations to leave. The orcs are sad that you did not kill the elves, but you did get rid of them, so you gain some friendship.{}{}
522:The elves stay away long enough for you to claim your reward from the orcs. {}{}
523:Good. Leave.
524:'Agreed, their way is one of chaos and destruction, and we do not wish to engage. We thank thee for the warning, friend. Be well.'{}{}{}{}They disappear back into the woodland and leave soon after. The orcs are sad that you did not kill the elves, but you did get rid of them, so you gain some friendship.{}{}
525:The elves return soon after the song ends, so the orcs are unimpressed with your trickery. {}{}{}{}But they too enjoyed your song, so you gain a bit of friendship.{}{}
526:You slay the elves and the orcs seem very happy. {}{}
527:'You speak with wisdom, yet we cannot leave this sapling here, nor is it ready to be taken away. We must remain.'
528:Say that you will try to stall the orcs long enough for the elves to move the young sapling away.
529:'Yes, your words are wise indeed, and we shall heed them. Do be watchful with whom you make friends, though. One should not have to face one's own kin in struggle when the wrong side is chosen.' {}{}{}{}They bow and begin preparations to leave. The orcs are sad that you did not kill the elves, but you did get rid of them, so you gain some friendship.
530:The orcs mock your failure and laugh in your face.
531:'Yes, your words are wise indeed, and we shall heed them. Do be watchful with whom you make friends, though. One should not have to face one's own kin in struggle when the wrong side is chosen.' {}{}{}{}They bow and begin preparations to leave.{}{}{}{}The orcs are happy that you got rid of them and reward you.
532:The elves honour their deal and soon depart.{}{}{}{}The orcs are sad that you did not kill the elves, but you did get rid of them, so you gain some friendship.{}{}
533:'It is not our way to be bought, yet we sense that you possess something we need. If you trade us five of your diamonds, we will be able to perform a ritual and thus leave this place in haste, just as you wish.'
534:'They may be of chaos, but we do not bend to the whims of turmoil. We will remain.'
535:'This will be a great boon indeed. We thank thee, forest child. We will attempt to leave with haste.'{}{}
536:Try to convince the orcs that they should wait.
537:Lie to the orcs to try to buy time.
538:'Bah, arrogant arseholes, the lot of you! This is our turf. They have no right to ask for more time.'{}{}{}{}The orcs go to deal with the elves themselves, and your friendship with them suffers greatly.
539:'Bah, you made deals on our behalf, so we will honour them. As long as those arrogant pointy ears are gone soon, we're happy.'
540:You tell the orcs that you chased the elves away, and they believe you. Luckily, they don't go to check.{}{}{}{}They are sad that you did not kill the elves, but you did get rid of them, so you gain some friendship.
541:'Lying scum, begone before we kill you!'{}{}{}{}The orcs go to deal with the elves themselves, and your friendship with them suffers greatly.
542:You find the spot where the orcs said demons are bothering them.
543:You have some knowledge of the mystical world and demons. Take a closer look.
544:[Wisdom]Demons like games, so play a game with them.
545:[Intellect]Try to tap into the wisdom of your domain to find a way to outsmart these creatures. 
546:[Karakandza]Claim this village as your turf!
547:You now see these are karakandza, nasty common demons whose tricks can be lethal. They are often found digging their way to the roots of the cosmic tree, forever trying to cause mischief even to the gods.
548:[Common demon]Try to out-trick your demon kin and make them leave here.
549:Speak to the demons. Try to convince them that the orcs are too much trouble, and they should search for human villages instead. 
550:Use your knowledge of demons to trick them into leaving and pursuing another village instead.
551:Karakandza are demons who feed on spirit. Offer them your own spirit so they leave.
552:The karakandza agree to a game of pure chance, fifty-fifty. The demons will take some of your spirit if you lose, but you know these are nasty creatures, and you feel their luck is not as strong as yours.
553:Agree to play -- the gods are on your side, after all.
554:You spin a tall tale about the orcs being boring and less prone to demon laws. You point out that humans have always been the thing and say you know of just the right village, ripe for the taking, and you point them in a fake direction.{}{}{}{}They buy it, and you hope they won't find you later.{}{}{}{}The orcs say that you proved your skill with trickery, not honour, so they are not very impressed.{}{}
555:These creatures are trickster demons. You lure them into a game, and when you win they agree to leave as their demon laws command.{}{}{}{}The orcs do not like trickery, but they are impressed with the power of your domain, so you gain some respect.{}{}
556:The dice were rolled, fate spoke, and the demons depart as agreed. {}{}{}{}The orcs dislike playing games with demons, but they understand your trust in fate, so you gain some respect.
557:You are about to report your success to the orcs when you discover that the karakandza tricked you because you were not precise enough in your deal. They left but came back the next day.{}{}{}{}The orcs laugh at your failure, but that gains you a bit of their friendship, at least.
558:The karakandza go away, but the orcs say all you proved is your stupidity, giving away your own strength to those creatures instead of killing them. 
559:The demons are slain, and the orcs are suitably impressed with your deeds.
560:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. The orcs laugh at your failure.
561:You are not successful, so the demons stay.
562:You convince the karakandza to go, although you suspect that the next Slavyan village will not be happy. {}{}{}{}The orcs say it is good that the demons are gone, but it hardly showed your honour to send them to another place.
563:You spin a tall tale about the orcs being boring and less prone to demon laws. You point out that humans have always been the thing. But the karakandza take it as a sign to make their presence more malicious and begin outright attacks on the orc settlement.{}{}{}{}The orcs are glad they can finally have a real fight, so they are happy with your resolution.{}{}
564:You make your claim and your kin accepts it.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed by the show of strength.{}{}
565:[Hunter]Track the demons.
566:[Harmony or Light]This creature reeks of darkness. Call upon your domain to banish it to the spirit realms where it belongs.
567:[Night demon]Claim this village as your turf!
568:Find them and attack!
569:Offer the demons your own life force, but beware -- you do not know exactly what they may take!
570:Speak to the demons, and say that your gods bid them to leave this place!
571:You witness a lone wolf succumb to a dark force and become possessed -- it is the bies that lurks here.
572:[Witch]The bies are often akin to your kind. Commune with them, and ask them to leave this turf to you.
573:The bies is a creature only partly physical, so face it in the spirit realms!
574:Offer your own spirit, mind, and body to feed the demons in exchange for leaving this place.
575:You observe the demons and discover they possess other life forms and are especially fond of wolves. You can try to lure them into a trap as you would a beast -- their bodies may still react on instinct.{}{}{}{}If it goes wrong, though, you may be putting yourself in a lot of danger.
576:Yes, do it.
577:'A sister of the dark arts. Yes. We will bow to your request, but perhaps one day we too will ask such favour. Be well, little witch.'{}{}{}{}The orcs respect the bies and witchcraft, bowing to your superiority.
578:The bies trick you instead and you are attacked!{}{}
579:The bies are banished from the physical realm, at least for now.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed by your power. {}{}
580:Your plan works and you kill the demons. {}{}{}{}The orcs, especially their bloodtrackers, like your style and you gain much respect.{}{}
581:You gave your own spirit, mind, and heart and the bies leave. 
582:Alas, just as you are about to report your successful mission, you discover that the bies were still hungry and returned.{}{}{}{}The orcs laugh at your stupidity in offering so much instead of killing the fiends.
583:You got rid of the bies, but the orcs laugh at your stupidity in offering so much instead of killing the fiends. {}{}{}{}You gain some friendship for making them laugh, though.{}{}
584:The bies are slain and the orcs accept this as proof of your brawn.{}{}
585:You are unconvincing, and the demons stay.
586:Just attack them!
587:Your scheming fails, and you are assailed by the bies.{}{}{}{}The orcs mock your failure and laugh in your face.{}{}
588:The bies bow down to your divine command and leave this area. {}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed by the might of your gods.{}{}
589:You speak to the bies, but it is you who bows down to their will. They possess your body and you are lost in dark ecstasy for a time. {}{}{}{}The orcs respect witchcraft, so they are unsure of what to make of this. You gain some wary respect from them.{}{}
590:You make your claim and your kin accepts it.{}{}{}{}The orcs are impressed, as they like the show of strength.{}{}
591:You come across the goblin encampment that the orcs want you to get rid of.
592:[Hunter or perception]Sneak up on them.
593:You see the goblins are indeed setting up a small settlement here. There are guards posted and small huts being built by some workers. You also hear the distinct squeak of wild boars nearby.{}{}{}{}The guards have not spotted you yet.
594:Approach them, weapons at the ready.
595:[Orc]Filthy little buggers, kill them!
596:[Hunter or intelligence]Play a long game. Set up some traps and poison their water. Stir up a lot of small trouble so they want to leave on their own.
597:You are ambushed by the goblins, and you realise they prepared a ritual that draws you into the spirit world!
598:You search the place and finally spot some goblins. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
599:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to tell them they need to leave, as the orcs do not want them here.
600:Try to look intimidating and tell them to beat it!
601:[Goblin]Say that the bastard orcs won't let them off easy. They are even determined enough to send outsiders to do the job.
602:You are badly beaten and the orcs have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.' {}{}
603:'Ah, you right, yes. They always bully us, even in the old days. But this here place is a gate to the greyworld, it is our duty to keep it safe. What we do?' {}{}
604:[Shaman]Offer your help to close the gateway so the orcs cannot defile it, then help them move out.
605:Insist that they depart within a day for their own safety.
606:Say that you will not force them to leave, even if this angers the orc brutes! This site should be protected.
607:'This site is sacred, gateway to greyworld, you go now!'{}{}{}{}The goblins are determined to stay.
608:The goblins jump to their feet, weapons only half drawn:{}{}{}{}'Oi, what you want here? You sent by those bullies, alpha clan? You tell 'em we stay, 'cause this is not their turf only. There's sacred spirit ground here and we stay!'
609:Admit that yes, you were told to get rid of the goblins. Say that it would be best to move along. Surely this is not a safe area to settle.
610:The goblins depart with a heavy heart, warning you to stay away from this site because the spirits will be angered by this.{}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.{}{}{}{}Later, you notice that the area has become infested with wraiths, but that's the orcs' problem now.
611:You kill the warriors and the rest flee. {}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.{}{}{}{}Later, you notice that the area has become infested with wraiths, but that's the orcs' problem now.
612:The shamans accept your aid, and together you close the gateway to the spirit greyworld. {}{}{}{}You then aid your kin in departing this land to find a safer place.{}{}{}{}'Our thanks are with you, friend. May the spirits speak well to you always.'
613:As you depart, the chieftain takes you aside: {}{}{}{}'The spirits spoke, and they say you take this child. It has no other. You be good to them.'{}{}
614:Bow in gratitude and accept the burden as is your goblin duty.
615:As you depart, the chieftain takes you aside: {}{}{}{}'The spirits spoke, and one will join you on your journey.'{}{}
616:Bow in gratitude and accept the ghost.
617:You try explaining your reasons to the orcs, but they do not listen:{}{}{}{}'How dare you! Move aside, and we will go slaughter the vermin ourselves.'
618:You tried. Let them go.
619:Convince them that this site is safer in goblin hands, or else they will have trouble with ghosts.
620:Kill the orcs!
621:'Ghosts, you say? Yeah, those little green buggers are good with them lot. We let them stay, as long as they make no trouble for us!'{}{}{}{}Both goblins and orcs are content with the compromise you worked out. 
622:The orcs ignore your pleading and attack the goblins in full force. Many die on both sides, but the orcs know how to fight on their turf, so they win.{}{}{}{}The goblins still appreciated your efforts, but the orcs do not respect failure.
623:The orcs are beaten, and you have them under your swords:{}{}{}{}'You win, ha! I guess you earnt the right to protect the gobbos for now.'
624:Kill the orcs so they cannot hurt the goblins later.
625:Leave them be, and hope honour will keep them at bay long enough for the goblins to get stronger.
626:The orcs beat you first and then attack the goblins in full force. Many die on both sides, but the orcs know how to fight on their turf, so they win.{}{}{}{}The goblins still appreciated your efforts, but the orcs do not respect failure.
627:You pester the goblins enough that they abandon plans to settle here. {}{}{}{}The orcs are pleased with your help and offer a small reward. Later, you notice that the area has become infested with wraiths, but that's the orcs' problem now.
628:An armed group of orcs stands before you.
629:Greet your allies. 
630:Stay cautious, but speak to them.
631:Intimidate them!
632:Move away.
633:'Battle sisters,  well met.'
634:Ask if they want to trade.
635:Have a drink together.
636:'You ain't our enemy, but you ain't our friends neither. Go to our village if you wanna make friends. Now, move away.'
637:'We bow to your dominance, we do as you say as is our custom when met with an alpha.'
638:Take their stuff and leave.
639:Your threats don't work. You are beaten and chased away.
640:You realise these are no ruins, but a burial ground of an orc clan.{}{}{}{}You see several old pyres and one that is new. You also spot a pack of wolves circling.
641:[Orc]Take a closer look at the pack to see if they have the mark of the starchasers.
642:You have the skills to deal with angry beasts. Watch the pack to figure out a way to handle this.
643:Attack the wolves!
644:[Horz] In the name of Horz, make them bow to you!
645:These wolves are indeed the starchasers, loyal companions to bloodtrackers, clearly guarding their masters' resting place.{}{}{}{}Their pack leader must be laid to rest here. It is best to leave them be, but if you want to loot the pyres (which is your right), you will need to face the wolves.{}{}
646:Avoid the pyre belonging to the wolves' former masters, and loot the others as is your right.
647:Kill the wolves. They are of no use once their master is gone.
648:These wolves are indeed the starchasers, loyal companions to bloodtrackers. {}{}{}{}They are left without a pack leader. This is your chance to claim their loyalty, but beware, it may become bloody!
649:[Bloodtracker] Show these wolves your raw will and make them heel!
650:[Matriarch] Dominate these wolves with your sheer power!
651:The wolves are beaten and submit to your charge. {}{}{}{}One of the wolves decides you are its new master.
652:Good. Gather the loot and leave.
653:The wolves are beaten and submit to your charge. {}{}{}{}This pack will continue to roam, but you will be able to call on its aid. {}{}{}{}
654:The wolves do not submit, and you barely escape their wrath.
655:To zmey with them! Attack instead!
656:Keep running.
657:You realise these wolves are feral, angry, and starving -- a dangerous combination. {}{}{}{}They will respond only to brute force or domination.
658:[Night demon] As a night demon, intimidate the beasts. 
659:Use your knowledge of wolves to dominate the pack!
660:[Nature] Try to reach the wolves' inner spirit to calm them in the name of nature. 
661:You defeat the wolves and are free to loot the funeral pyres.{}{}{}{}One of the wolves decides you are the new alpha, so now you can call on its aid.{}{}
662:You kill the wolves and are free to loot the funeral pyres.
663:The wolves are beaten and submit to your charge. {}{}{}{}This pack will continue to roam, but you may be able to call on its aid. {}{}
664:The wolves submit to your charge. {}{}{}{}This pack will continue to roam, but you are free to loot the pyres.{}{}
665:As you explore, you notice long-dead humanoid remains scattered all over the place. {}{}{}{}They look larger than human, possibly orcish. 
666:Leave the bones be and continue searching for loot. 
667:[Orc]Prepare funeral pyres so the dead may be honoured.
668:Bury the bodies out of respect first. 
669:The unnatural forces binding these unliving are still weak. Try to break this bond and thus free their souls.
670:Leave this place.
671:The ritual works, and you free the unliving souls. 
672:Search the ruins.
673:The funeral pyres burn high and you utter the guttural charge command so the souls of the fallen may rise in their final call to battle. {}{}{}{}Your spirits are lifted as you feel the presence of the fallen now at peace. 
674:Good. Continue checking the ruins for any usable loot.
675:The funeral pyres burn high and you utter the guttural charge command so the souls of the fallen may rise in their final call to battle. 
676:You bury the bodies according to your custom. Alas, you feel the spirits' heavy unrest in the air, and your own souls feel burdened by it. {}{}
677:Continue searching the ruins. 
678:Continue to search for anything useful.
679:You bury the bodies according to your custom, but perhaps the fallen orcs did not like it, as they rise to attack you!
680:Speak to your unliving kin to calm their anger and offer aid.
681:As nature and harmony sway your soul, use your domain to weaken these unliving before killing them for good!
682:You bury the bodies according to your custom and no unliving rise to kill you, so you likely did well.
683:'We... we cannot rest. The dark pulls at us, keeps us here... fire, fire to our bones!'{}{}{}{}One of the unliving connects with your mind, and suddenly you know the proper orcish way to lay them to rest.
684:Create a funeral pyre and lead the unliving to it, as is their wish.
685:Just kill the unliving.
686:You defeat the unliving after they were weakened by your domain's intervention. However, it dawns on you that you had a peaceful way of resolving this, so your spirits suffer for this act of violence. 
687:Damn. Keep searching the ruins for loot.
688:Your efforts are futile and the unliving attack!
689:With the dead, well, dead again, you can now search the ruins in peace.
690:Gather up what you can and leave.
691:The unliving overwhelm you and force you to run for your lives.
692:As you search the old rubble, you hear the voice of a female orc:{}{}{}{}'We witnessed from afar your honourable deed, as expected from a sister, of course. Here, we found some loot that we cannot carry on the long road ahead. Take it and serve the gods well!'
693:Pound your chest in thanks and bid them farewell. Finish checking the ruins and leave.
694:As you are about to depart, you hear the roaring voice of an orc warrior bellowing at you:{}{}{}{}'You showed our warriors respect and did not let their defiled bodies walk as unliving scourges. Here, have this as our thanks.'
695:Thank them and depart.
696:Before you can take your treasure, you hear the roaring voice of an orc warrior bellowing at you:{}{}{}{}'We claim this ruin as our turf, as marked by our fallen kin!'{}{}
697:Keep listening. Best not to further enrage an already angry orc.
698:You help dig out the bodies and make proper funeral pyres in accordance with orc customs.
699:Good. Take your loot and leave.
700:You help dig out the bodies and make proper funeral pyres in accordance with orc customs.{}{}{}{}The orcs appreciate your aid, and add some metals as a reward before they bid you farewell.
701:The orc warrior growls, her sharp, exposed teeth glimmering at you, but then she laughs: {}{}{}{}'Ha! You have a warrior heart and you respected our fallen. You may leave, and may your path be filled with good enemies and strong friends.'
702:Wish them well too and leave.
703:'You fought well for weakling fleshies. You have tits! Good.{}{}{}{}All this fighting got me hungry. Leave your food, leave the loot, and you're free to go.'
704:Praise their honour and leave.
705:Whoever these dead folks were, their killers took off with much of what was usable here, but you still see some salvageable resources and a few scattered weapons that may be good.
706:Take the stuff and leave.
707:You gather up what little is left in the ruins, but just as you lift a skeleton to pick up its sword, you hear footsteps behind you and see some unliving!
708:'But I tell you what, you showed respect to the dead, even though you buried them instead of burnin'... So help us dig them out and make funeral pyres and you can keep half of the loot.'
709:Agree to help with the bodies. 
710:[Turmoil] As turmoil is your path, stand firm and say you will not yield to their demands. The loot is yours, and if they think otherwise, they can fight you for it.
711:'So you surrender... weak, cowardly, and you claim to follow the path of turmoil, do you? Pathetic.'{}{}{}{}The warrior spits in your face and her men kick you out of the ruins, taking away your loot but, surprisingly, not your equipment.
712:'Ah, true warriors, good! Do with us as you will. We yield to your swords!'
713:Kill them all and take their stuff.
714:Take only the loot you found in the ruins, and leave the orcs be.{}{}
715:You find the scattered remains of an old orcish settlement. {}{}{}{}In the old days, the clans were mostly nomadic, so this is a rare find. {}{}{}{}You soon realise that the area is riddled with traps, surely protecting something farther in.
716:The traps are old. Simply smash them.
717:[Intellect]Allow intellect to clear your mind and find a path through these traps.
718:You're a craftsman. Use your skills to disarm these traps.
719:You destroy most of the traps, but some leave you with cuts and bruises. 
720:The traps may be old, but there are just too many. You leave with cuts and bruises and nothing more.
721:There are not a lot of valuables here, but you manage to gather some useful resources.{}{}
722:Gather what you found and leave.
723:You discover a buried chest with some of its contents still intact. {}{}
724:You see a safe path that will take you to the centre of these ruins.{}{}
725:You disarm the traps without trouble. {}{}
726:Your mind remains muddled, and you feel depressed by it. {}{}
727:You find the scattered remains of an old orcish settlement. {}{}{}{}In the old days, the clans were mostly nomadic, so this is a rare find. {}{}{}{}As you search the crude yet sturdy old structures, you spot a group of orcs also arriving here.
728:[Orc]Assert the right of the strongest to claim this find. 
729:[Orc]Try talking to your kin. 
730:[Zorya and Mysticism] Shout to them that like the daughters of Zorya that rule their own clans, you too follow the warrior goddess and thus have the right to these spoils!
731:[Harmony] In the name of harmony, try to talk to them.
732:Try to negotiate.
733:'Ah, the misguided children of our mistress, yes! {}{}{}{}You allow men in your ranks as equals. This belittles you, but perhaps one day you will learn.{}{}{}{}This is no mere ruin, but a proving ground of old. If you wish to seek rewards here, you will face our spirit, and we'll see if you're true.'{}{}
734:Agree to take part in a spirit ritual.
735:Refuse and attack!
736:'Ah, the claim right, yes. One of you against one of ours. Females only, of course -- I would not disrespect you with a male.'{}{}
737:You are orc and you are female. Agree!
738:An orc is an orc. Insist that an orc male will face them!
739:You have no orc female, but any female can do this!
740:Refuse and attack instead!
741:Refuse and leave. 
742:'Shut your traps before we shut them! This is our spot, so beat it!'
743:Pompous bastards. Attack them instead!
744:'Oh, just stop yapping! We do not waste our blades on talkers. {}{}{}{}Go, search the outskirts and be glad of the scraps you find there. It is an honour we don't allow easily.'
745:'Ha! Good female brawn, yes, you understand, and you did well by beating me! This land is yours to loot.'
746:Thank them and start exploring.
747:Allow the orcs to search the outer parts of the land. They fought well and deserve the honour.
748:An orc shaman steps up and feeds you a wretched concoction that tastes of metal and dirt. {}{}{}{}The orcs begin a strange warrior dance and you try your best to join in, asking Zorya's guidance as you do so.
749:Open your souls to Zorya's path and show those orcs you are true.
750:'Surrender!'{}{}{}{}The orcs spit, turn away from you, and wait for you to leave in shame.
751:'Well fought! But these other gods of yours clearly weaken your body and mind, friend. Only Zorya can make you true!{}{}{}{}We won, so it is our turf, but you can search the outer rim. You earned it.'
752:'Argh, I will not yield to a male equal. Of course, I was going easy on you. {}{}{}{}But fair is fair, you have proven your worth, and you shame me. This land is yours to loot.'
753:'Surrender! You male piece of shit, how dare you dishonour orc blood so!'{}{}{}{}The orc spits in your face with disgust, then growls at you, her fists clenched.
754:You kill the orcs, and the ruins now lie before you for the looting!
755:'Yes! Your spirits are strong, and turmoil runs deep in your souls, so we accept your kinship. {}{}{}{}We will search these ruins side by side.'
756:Agree and begin the exploration.
757:'Your spirit is weak. If you do follow Zorya, you have much yet to learn.{}{}{}{}This land is ours to loot. Leave.'
758:You search the old ruins until you realise that a dark, foreboding mist is descending upon this place. {}{}{}{}The black mist is a dreaded remnant of the days of darkness.
759:Call upon light or harmony to protect you from this dark power. 
760:Call upon turmoil or magic to shield you from the darkness.
761:You have skilled wise ones with you. Battle this force of the dark with your spirit!
762:Try to sneak quickly past the mist to get to the possible loot in these ruins.
763:[Shadow elf]The black mist is no danger to you. Walk through it and finish searching the ruins.
764:Alas, your divine domain serves only as a beacon for the black mist to strike.{}{}{}{}You are engulfed by its dark clutches, which tear deep into your soul with dread and madness!
765:Do not let this darkness win. Gather your spirit and fight it!
766:Your domain shields you as the dreaded mist tries to claw its way into your very souls. {}{}{}{}Still uneasy from the experience, you can try to search this place for loot and hope the mist won't come after you again.{}{}
767:Take what you find and leave. 
768:The black mist cannot be beaten easily. Before you know it, deep, penetrating darkness engulfs you in its cold clutches and tears at your mind and soul. {}{}
769:Run!
770:You defeat the darkness and can now attempt to siphon its power.
771:Siphon the energy.
772:Do not risk meddling with the mist. Search the ruins for loot.
773:By the skin of your teeth you manage to avoid the mist, although you still feel some dread lingering, and you find a decent stash of goods for looting.
774:Gather any loot you find and leave.
775:You siphon some of the dark energy safely, protected by the divine domain of magic. {}{}
776:Check the ruins for any loot and leave.
777:You try to siphon the dark energy, but it does not sit well with your divine domain. {}{}{}{}A spirit sickness befalls you.{}{}
778:You siphon some of the dark energy safely.
779:The dark mist destroys most of what once stood here, but you find a fairly fresh corpse to loot. 
780:The power of darkness seeps into your spirit, strengthening it from within.
781:Good. Gather any loot you find and leave.
782:You try to siphon the dark energy, but darkness is a fickle friend. {}{}{}{}A spirit sickness befalls you.{}{}
783:You come across a cave. Its entrance looks like it was once inhabited, but it is now overgrown and dark. 
784:Scout the cave first.
785:You scout the cave and see bear tracks. Oddly, you only spot the tracks within the cave, never outside. {}{}{}{}As you peer deeper in, you see a broken wheelbarrow, some other tattered equipment, and a sleeping bear.
786:[Animal kin or Nature] You sense something odd about the creature. Observe it awhile longer.
787:Sneak past it to gather whatever usable loot lies in the cave.
788:You enter the cave. It is dark and damp, but there are signs of humanoid life, broken furniture, and a crooked wheelbarrow.{}{}{}{}Before you can investigate further, you spot a bear. It looks at you and shakes its head and paws, as if trying to wave you away. Then it stops. You hear more roaring and the bear charges!
789:The bears beat you badly and force you to flee.
790:You kill the bear and its pack, and you are free to loot the cave.
791:One of the younger bears survives and now follows your lead. Leave.
792:'Cursed bearskin, wheelbarrow, daddy, prison, witch help, bears scary.'{}{}{}{}The bear's voice sounds like a child speaking, and you guess that it has been cursed. The bear points to a small bear figurine you now see on the floor. 
793:Destroy the figurine.
794:Unravel the figurine's magic carefully before destroying it.
795:The bear stirs and wakes, but does not seem to smell or notice you. Instead it sits there, staring at the floor. 
796:Try speaking to the bear.
797:[Magic user]You sense a strong presence of magic from the bear. Perform a ritual of cleansing to reveal any hidden mystical weaves. 
798:The bear looks up at you, its big brown eyes tearful. It grunts and growls, neither humanoid language nor the tongue of the wild, but a strange mix of the two. {}{}
799:Try to figure out what the bear is saying.
800:You identify a small bear figurine as the totem to which the bear's curse is bound.{}{}{}{}Your ritual slowly unravels the magic weaves and reveals old, dark magic at hand here. 
801:Continue to cleanse the cave.
802:You sneak past the bear and gather up some resources. {}{}{}{}Among the stuff is a small bear figurine, which broke when you left the threshold of the cave. As you look back, you see the bear twist and die in terrible pain. 
803:As you move away, a ghost seems to have attached itself to your service.
804:The crushed figurine turns to flesh and blood and, as it dies, so does the bear. However, the animal slowly turns into a young girl wearing extravagant clothes. Her body decays in minutes until there are only bones left. {}{}
805:Lay the bones to rest.
806:A spirit appears, bows in a funny sort of way, and says: 'I thank thee, kind knights of the realm. You did me a great service by rescuing me from a wicked curse. I hope my remains will provide reward for your knightly services.'{}{}
807:Ask the ghost for its story.
808:The ghost will now aid you in need as well. Nod and gather the riches from the bones. 
809:Nod and gather the riches from the bones. 
810:The crushed figurine turns to flesh and blood and, as it dies, so does the bear. It screams in pain in a girl's voice. {}{}{}{}All signs of its humanity disappear and the animal becomes just that -- a beast. {}{}{}{}It is, however, free to leave the cave and it does so, looking back at you with a final glimmer of human gratitude, or perhaps sadness.{}{}
811:The bear will come to your side when you need it.
812:Gather whatever usable remains you can, and leave.
813:You carefully untangle the magic from the bear figurine and feel its tight grip on the bear weaken. {}{}{}{}But the curse is ancient, and there is no time for proper rituals. {}{}{}{}All you can do is choose the fate of the bear. Either allow it to die, and let its human spirit be freed from its bonds. Or let the bear live, but it will be a beast, and no sentience will remain.
814:Choose to release the human spirit.
815:Choose to let the bear live. 
816:The animal slowly turns into a young girl wearing extravagant clothes. Her body decays in minutes until there are only bones left. {}{}
817:'I was once a lady, a princess. Daddy did not like me leaving the castle. He said it was getting dark, with beasty folk everywhere. You are not safe, he said, you must stay in the tower.'
818:Stay silent.
819:Ask what a princess is, exactly. It does not sound like a Slavyan role.
820:'I stayed, but it was so boring. A lady in waiting came once. She was pretty. She told me she would make it so I could roam all the lands free, strong, and safe from any dangers. I clapped my hands and agreed to her terms, even though they were peculiar.'
821:Peculiar?
822:'She said to ask for a wheelbarrow and bearskin from my father, to tell him it was my greatest wish, which he must grant with a blessing. And of course, Daddy did.{}{}{}{}She told me to wear the bearskin, ride the wheelbarrow, and think of the wild woods. I did.'
823:Ask if that is when she was turned into a bear.
824:'Yes. But she lied, she lied so. I was trapped again, but now I was alone in the skin of a beast. Other bears would come, do things... bring nasty flesh, and my bestial body devoured it like candy...'{}{}{}{}The princess weeps.{}{}
825:Ask what happened to the witch.
826:'She came a few times at first, laughed at me, said my daddy deserved it, that all his might would not bring me back, for he would never find his princess, only a bear in a cave.'
827:Ask if her father ever found her.
828:The ghost nods sadly. 'In a way. His hunters came, saw my things in this cave, and thought the bear ate the princess. They wanted to hurt me, so I and the bears, we... we ate them...'{}{}{}{}The ghost sobs again.
829:Comfort her and tell her she is now free.
830:Ask if she knows where the witch is now.
831:The ghost looks at you and nods, although you can see it remains tormented. {}{}{}{}It slowly fades away, leaving you in the empty cave.
832:'Yes, now that you have freed me, I sense her foul presence. The wretched thing dwells not far from here.'{}{}{}{}She shivers in anger.
833:'A daughter to a king, of course. Peasants do ask the funniest questions. {}{}{}{}Or is it that the dark I felt outside has taken even kings and queens, just like the evil witch said? {}{}{}{}Matters little now. I shall continue my story uninterrupted.'
834:Nod.
835:The bear screams out in pain in a girl's voice. {}{}{}{}All signs of its humanity disappear and the animal becomes just that -- a beast. {}{}{}{}It is, however, free to leave this cave and it does so, looking back at you with a final glimmer of human gratitude, or perhaps sadness.{}{}
836:The curse is ancient, too strong to be truly undone. {}{}{}{}But you can destroy it, which will free the spirit of the human trapped inside.{}{}{}{}Or you can balance the union of bear and human. The form will remain animal, but the spirit will be human and in control. However, this path has a risk of failing and turning the trapped person into a pure beast.{}{}
837:Choose the path of the bear.
838:The bear screams out in pain in a girl's voice, but when it stops, it looks at you, confused:{}{}{}{}'What... what have you done to me? I am a beast now, truly? But then... I am free...'{}{}
839:Ask the bear for its story.
840:The bear decides to join you, as it does not want to stay out in the wilderness alone. Leave together.
841:The bear leaves but the cave holds remains of others who lived here before. Take what you can and leave.
842:'Yes, I am free. In this skin... forever...'{}{}
843:As you try to unravel the bear's mystery, you are surprised by more animals, angry and territorial, which chase you away. 
844:You sneak in and gather some goods, but the bears wake and attack you viciously, forcing you to flee.{}{}
845:[Intellect or Nature ]Inspired by your domain, try to find a quick way to deal with the spiders without a fight.
846:The spiders are dead, but more might be coming. You find the remains of other victims caught in the webs.
847:Run.{}
848:There's something interesting on the horizon.
849:You find the scattered remains of an old orcish settlement. {}{}{}{}In the old days, the clans were mostly nomadic, so this is a rare find. {}{}{}{}The remains seem entirely abandoned. 
850:Search. 
851:Caught off guard by a hurricane, you find a cave you can take shelter in.
852:Take cover in the cave.
853:Brave the hurricane. 
854:You take cover in the cave, but you soon realise you are not alone. A set of hungry wolf eyes is staring at you, and more wolves are sleeping inside. Worse yet, you spot some shapes that indicate werewolves lead this pack.
855:Focus on your divine domain for guidance.
856:[Night demon] Call out to your kin and ask for shelter.
857:[Horz] Dominate these werewolves, make them bow to you!
858:You try to push through and outrun the hurricane, but it throws you about a few times before you manage it.
859:The howling of wolves fills the cave. Snarls and growling follow, but eventually the pack moves deeper into the cave, allowing you to take shelter in peace. {}{}{}{}There is a chance that some of the wolves may decide to follow your pack now.
860:Wait till the hurricane ends and leave. 
861:The howling of wolves fills the cave. Snarls and growling follow, but eventually the pack moves deeper into the cave, allowing you to take shelter in peace. {}{}{}{}There is a chance that some of the wolves may decide to follow your pack now.{}{}
862:You feel the influence of turmoil and nature, and you know you must dominate these werewolves as an alpha would. Only the strongest may lead.
863:Face the wolves.
864:Fight normally.
865:You kill the werewolves and you're free to take shelter in the cave. {}{}{}{}You even discover a small amount of good stone within.
866:Leave when the storm is over.
867:You beat the werewolves. The rest of the pack submits to your dominance and leaves. 
868:The werewolves beat you badly and chase you away from their turf. 
869:You discover a young wolf still alive and willing to join your pack.
870:Take the wolf and leave.
871:The wolves snarl and growl at you, snapping their angry jaws. {}{}{}{}You must either face them or turn back into the hurricane.
872:Face the hurricane.
873:State your domain of magic or your affinity to the mystical arts, and ask if she would be kind enough to teach you. 
874:You are sent to speak to an orc witch. Her name - Eater of Souls - strikes fear and respect in the hearts of those you speak to. As she approaches you, others cower away:{}{}{}{}'You come asking about the big light, yes? Those foul lightbringers that kill so many of our orc kin. But why should I say anything to the likes of you? What are your gods to me?'
875:[Zorya]It is Zorya's or Zorza's will that this must be resolved!
876:Out of all the peoples of Slavya, it is the orcs who most share the pantheon with humans, only in different hierarchies. Surely your god can see eye to eye on this?
877:'Bah, yes! You are right - we fight for the same mistress, so I won't beat around the bush. In truth, I had visions of the champion coming, and I serve as you do. Even if it means talking about an uncomfortable past.'
878:So this past can help?
879:'Perhaps. You see, we are not learned like your scholars, nor long-lived like the pointy ears and stone folk, and we do not commune with spirits as well as the green midgets. {}{}{}{}But we are born of darkness and chaos. We sense it, it speaks to us. And it tells us this light seeks to burn us to the bone.'
880:But do they know how to trap the light again and restore this earth-heart?
881:'No. I do not. And as much as we listen to the whispers, our blood boils and we seek to fight. {}{}{}{}But to fight, we need a weapon. Just as the pointy ears were cursed by darkness before the Awakening, we are now weakened by this light.'
882:Does she know of such a weapon?
883:'I know of one who walks the dark path beyond even my understanding. I should know - he is my pup.{}{}{}{}He meddles with the forces of death and life, and delves into darkness so deep. Foolish, foolish youth. But he tried to speak to me. Tried to tell me. I will not dishonour my alpha and talk to Shame Bringer, but you should. '
884:[Orc]A male who wields magic? Why is he alive?
885:Thank her for the information and leave.
886:'Argh! Do not assume to question me. I left him alone on the burning plains. He was supposed to die, but he did not. He may be shameful, but he has earnt his life, and any who tells me otherwise will taste my blade!'
887:'Yes, you may be misguided in not recognising Zorza as your alpha goddess, but you honour her and the hunt master well enough. In truth, I had visions of the champion coming, and I serve as you do. Even if it means talking about an uncomfortable past.'
888:You approach the tower of Shame Bringer, the orc who supposedly has a way to beat this growing light. {}{}{}{}The place is unremarkable - a single stone-built tower. The only oddity is the lack of any visible entrance. 
889:Walk up to the tower and tell the orc you were sent here by Eater of Souls, his mother.
890:Walk up to the tower and tell the orc you were sent here by the goblin shamans.
891:An orc male comes out of the tower as if he just walked through the stone.{}{}{}{}'The shamans? Interesting. I did not calculate for such an outcome, though now that you mention it, it does make sense. They too are creatures woven from chaos, magic, and darkness more than light and harmony.'
892:Does he know how to stop the light?
893:Ask him what his story is. Male orcs who use magic are not common.
894:Implore the orc to tell you how to defeat the light in the simplest possible terms. You have no time for stories and do not care for his motives.
895:'No, we are not. When talent for the mystical shows in a male, the mother is supposed to kill the child. {}{}{}{}Mine is the alpha's best witch. She was granted permission to leave my fate in the hands of chance. And chance favoured me, it seems. I was abandoned to die on the burning plains, but I survived. I called out for death to claim me. Instead it let me live.'
896:[Nyia]Death answered? How so?
897:So what is it that he does? 
898:'It was not your mistress, if that is what you ask. It was a lady clad in dark feathers. Death and winter followed her every step. Sadness and wisdom wrapped her neck.{}{}{}{}She said I must use my wits to survive, and only then will the kingdom of death listen to my command. I found myself drowning in darkness and her voice guided me back.'
899:'I am what others call a necromancer. A crude word, but it will suffice. I have mastered the art of undeath. My creatures walk this earth and do my bidding, but there is so much more. {}{}{}{}I delve into the realms of death. I stare into the face of darkness and walk the many paths of chaos.'
900:[Nyia]He claims to have been saved by a lady of death, but necromancy is an affront to the natural circle!
901:How can necromancy help stop the Shattering?
902:'Yes. And she knew it, too, when she saved my life. She could have set me on a path of her choosing, but she did not, claiming that I must make my own fate. {}{}{}{}She has never appeared to me again, but I choose to believe that my path is just as much a part of the circle of life as anything. And now we are here, me holding dark answers, you seeking them.'
903:'My art of necromancy cannot help directly, but I can. I have learnt a truth. Only darkness can defeat this light. Think on it. {}{}{}{}After the Awakening, we had peace in the grey times, where neither the light nor the dark overwhelmed - a truce. And yes, the black mist's presence will often cause chaos, but it was good.'
904:What is he talking about?
905:'The cosmic tree was neither saved nor burned. It remained in stasis as it was. And this worked - until the lightbringers came. Someone did not like the new truce. So they released the light.{}{}{}{}I can tell you how to make a heart of darkness. Plant it in the earth-cave and destroy the light-beast for good.'
906:For good?
907:'Yes, the heart will not only slay the host flesh, but also corrupt the light altogether. Some will survive, but not enough to cause trouble. The darkness that still lingers in this world will be enough to keep it in check, maybe even defeat it in time.'
908:So he is proposing sabotage? A fake heart designed to destroy, not restore, the old ways?
909:And the Shattering?
910:'Yes.'
911:Will this not bring back the age of darkness?
912:How can this heart of darkness be made?
913:This whole plan is dangerous and cannot be allowed to succeed. Attack the necromancer!
914:'Not entirely, no. The cosmic tree is alive from what I gather, no? I mean, you do serve the gods and they do rely on it. {}{}{}{}So the core of darkness will remain at bay. Only what is left here with us will strengthen. It will be a change. It may in fact affect the pointy ears.'
915:How?
916:'They are born of light as we are of darkness. They will likely suffer the curse again. But they survived once, so I am sure they can make it again.'
917:'In short, make a heart of darkness that will corrupt light and destroy much of it. Darkness will be able to fight off the rest and the Shattering should cease, as it is caused by the lightbringers escaping the earth's core.'
918:'The earth shatters as the lightbringers escape the core and come up topside. With the light corrupted, the tremors should stop in time.'
919:Why is he seeking to aid you?
920:'The mroki were once giants, you know? They were changed by darkness and over time became something entirely new. But their hearts, infused with my magic, will trick the mechanism in the living cave into thinking it is a giant's heart. {}{}{}{}You will of course need to defeat the light-beast that now guards the chamber. But if you agree, I will aid you. And remember, not every mroki will have a heart, so it may take some hunting.'
921:Agree and go hunt for some mroki. They can be found in the darkness, in volcanic biomes,.
922:Refuse and leave.
923:'Pride? Wanting to impress my heartless mother? Or pure survival, maybe. After all, I am master of darkness - dominance of light or even pure balance are not my friends. If you go my way, I will be stronger, of course.'
924:An orc male comes out of the tower as if he just walked through the stone.{}{}{}{}'So, she did listen, but she was too cowardly to come! Or is it a sign of her brilliance that also resides within me that she should use the champions of other gods to do her bidding? It matters not, for you are here, willing to listen.'
925:The necromancer's body turns to dark mist and dissolves. You must find other ways to stop the Shattering.{}{}{}{}Perhaps you can go back to the red cave and speak to the Alchemist again, rescue that dwarf from a prison or seek aid from elves or dwarves.{}{}
926:'Fools, blind fools!'{}{}{}{}The necromancer defeats you and curses your names. He then disappears with his tower. You must find other ways to stop the Shattering.{}{}{}{}Perhaps you can go back to the red cave and speak to the Alchemist again.
927:'Fools, blind fools!'{}{}{}{}The necromancer disappears with his tower. You must find other ways to stop the Shattering.{}{}{}{}Perhaps you can go back to the red cave and speak to the Alchemist again, rescue that dwarf from a prison or seek aid from elves or dwarves.
928:You find a tower, within there are bones and signs of occupancy, but whoever lived here is long gone.
929:The orc encampment is full of ash and bones of the fallen. It looks like the lightbringers came here after their power increased. {}{}{}{}The place is dead.
930:'As friend of the alpha clans, you are invited to take part in the fighting pits - as spectator. {}{}{}{}Losers of such fights will be dishonoured and live in shame, so some of them come to you after and ask to be accepted into your 'clan' instead. You would have to pay a clan price to the alphas, to ensure some shreds of honour are saved.'{}{}{}{}[You can only recruit in this faction once, with a small chance for second when your population if very low]
931:Agree to pay a clan price for a fighter.
932:Ask if this isn't a type slavery and weren't orcs violently against slavery due to their past?
933:Agree to pay for a worker.
934:'Good. They carry the biggest clan-price, as they are strong, but they may die from their wounds. Go, see who wants to join your clan.'{}{}{}{}[You can only recruit in this faction once, with a tiny chance for second when your population is very low]
935:Pay the honour price for a fighter.
936:[Orc, Dwarf or Turmoil] Say you will fight instead of paying, it is the honourable way.
937:Pay the honour price for a bloodtracker.
938:Pay the honour price for an orc child who failed their battle trials.
939:Children can also lose their honour here?
940:There no one who wants to join right now, or it is not the right time for you. Leave.
941:'A good fight, you are worthy of being the alpha to our kin. May the fire in your heart never die!'
942:Accept the honour and welcome your new comrade.
943:'How dare you! You are friend, so I will not kill you. They are free women and men. They can go with you any time without paying the clan price. They will lose their honour and become clanless of course. This is why they ask you to pay. That way, you become their alpha and we can respect that.{}{}{}{}You can of course fight for the honour of becoming their alpha as well?'
944:Thank them for the explanation. Say you will consider this honour price for a fighter then.
945:Say you will fight instead of paying, it is the honourable way.
946:'Yes. Every orc child must pass their first battle trial as soon as they are tall enough to hold a knife. {}{}{}{}Those who fail, have a chance to regain honour later, but it is unlikely. Many mothers would rather free such child into another clan, give them a fresh start.'
947:Agree to pay a clan price for a fighter. 
948:'You are weak, our kin will not do well in your clan. Return only when your fire burns true.'
949:'They carry a lesser honour price as they were already dishonoured in the past and this was their second chance to become more. It is likely their morale will be very low.'
950:Pay the honour price for a craftsman.
951:Pay the honour price for a gatherer.
952:A bloodtracker approaches you:{}{}{}{}'You, you pay me, I train your pet to do some real damage!'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will only raise it to fourth rank, with only a small chance for higher and you can only train one pet at a time]
953:Yes, give a cat to be trained.
954:Yes, give a wolf to be trained.
955:Yes, give a bear to be trained.
956:Yes, give a boar to be trained.
957:No, leave.
958:Yes, give a spider to be trained.
959:'Are you crazy? Can't train cats! Do I look like a wizard to you? Them lot are more likely to scratch my eyes out than listen.'
960:Ask about other pets.
961:'Fee paid, good. Now hand me that pet for training.'
962:Hand over the pet.
963:Your pet returns after a while and it seems much better behaved.
964:Thank the trainer and leave.
965:'Fee paid, good, now hand me that pet for training.'
966:Your pet returns after a while and seems much better behaved.
967:'So, you seek to improve your familiars, good. Pay me and it shall be done.'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will only raise it to fourth rank, no higher and you can only train one pet at a time]
968:Yes, give a crow to be trained.
969:Pay with your spirit to train the cat.
970:Pay with your spirit to train the spider.
971:Pay with your spirit to train the crow.
972:'Fee paid, good, now I take your familiar and teach it some new tricks.'
973:One of your people who previously lost faith in you has taken up residence in the city. Now that they had the time to rest and reflect, they would like to join you again.
974:Accept them.
975:Decline, you do not need weaklings!
976:They are happy to be part of the family again. 
977:Your journey is interrupted.
978:See what is happening.
979:As you cross the woodland in search of good resources, you notice that the trees are covered in thick cobwebs.
980:[Turmoil]Embrace fate and charge ahead.
981:[Nature]Trust in whatever nature decides to throw in your path.
982:Why wait? Charge in and seek out the spiders to kill them!
983:[Hunter]Find a safe path.
984:Find an alternate path.
985:Leave altogether.
986:A spider queen stands in your way, be it by chance or fate -- both lie within your domain's reach. {}{} 
987:Stay true to your path and attack!
988:Actually, no. Leave.
989:Nature was kind this time, and although you did spot several giant spiders, they did not attack, sensing that you wish them no harm.{}{}{}{}You are free to gather the goods.
990:You find a safe path between the webs, and you reach the grove you were searching for to gather some wood and supplies. {}{}{}{}You also spot the spider nest.
991:Go kill the spiders!
992:[Hunter]Set a trap.
993:Gather what you came for and leave.
994:You fight your way through the spiderwebs and find some dead bodies of those who were not so lucky. Eventually, you reach the grove where you look for the resources. 
995:The spiders are dead. You find the remains of some unfortunate souls taken by the beasts.
996:The spiders beat you badly and force you to flee. Nasty spider bites linger as you run.
997:The spider queen lies at your feet as a trophy and sign of your prowess. You feel empowered by your domain.{}{}{}{}Afterwards, you reach the grove where you look for the resources. 
998:You find another path, but some of the spiders still come after you. You take a few nasty bites before you get away. {}{}{}{}You do, however, reach the grove and gather some wood.
999:The trap works well. Some spiders lie dead, and the others run off. You find the remains of some unfortunate souls taken by the beasts.
1000:As night falls, you hear the howling of wolves likely out on the prowl.
1001:[Night demon]Command these wolves to obey your alpha howl!
1002:[Wolf]Howl back and signal that your pack is not here to challenge them.
1003:Stand firm and fight!
1004:[Hunter]Set a wolf trap.
1005:Your presence screams dominance into the night, and the wolves heel to your will.{}{}{}{}They also abandon the prey they already caught. 
1006:You howl and the other pack responds in kind. {}{}{}{}They circle around you but do not attack. You can either try to dominate them or leave their hunting grounds.
1007:Dominate.
1008:The hunted becomes the hunter as you stalk the wolf pack quietly. You pick off a few stragglers, so the pack should be easier to deal with now.
1009:Lead the wolves into a trap.
1010:The wolves are gaining on you, so you are forced to drop some of your food to escape.
1011:The wolves beat you badly and force you to flee. Some of your wounds become infected.
1012:You fail to dominate the pack and they chase you off their hunting ground, wounded but not dead.
1013:As you cross the woodland, you come across some wild piglets. 
1014:Where there are piglets, there's surely an overprotective mother nearby. Cautiously observe the area.
1015:[Beastmaster]Wild piglets are perfect for taming, but first you must lure one out without it alerting its mother.
1016:[Hunter]A mama boar is surely nearby. Set a trap so you separate the pack and only hunt a smaller batch.
1017:Go in closer to try to capture the piglets.
1018:Sure enough, you soon spot a small pack of older boars rummaging through the foliage. 
1019:It is harmful to the herd to kill piglets or the mother. Instead, separate the weaker males to hunt them.
1020:Better not risk harming the young. Circle around the pack and leave.
1021:You lure away a strong piglet and train it to become your very own boar.
1022:You try to catch the piglets, but a pack of angry boars charges you instead. {}{}{}{}Luckily, you are able to fight them off.
1023:The boars beat you badly and force you to flee.
1024:You try to separate the pack, but you fail and are forced to kill the mother and the young. {}{}{}{}This is not the way of nature, but you do get more meat and leather.
1025:No matter how hard you try, those little piglets are determined to stick together, close to their mother. You're worn out when you hear the grunts of the old boar and are forced to back away.
1026:It is harmful to the herd to kill piglets or the mother, so you feel the burden of your disrespect for nature.
1027:You see a dark cloud approaching at an oddly high speed.
1028:Scout ahead.
1029:Brace yourself for whatever this is.
1030:You notice that it is a flock of crows heading your way, but they are not behaving naturally. {}{}{}{}They do not follow wind currents, instead moving through the sky like an ugly hammer, nor do they communicate with one another, instead flying in eerie silence. Their typically beady black eyes emit a dull white glow. 
1031:Attack these abominations!
1032:[Turmoil and Magic]This is a perversion of light, and as such, your domain suffers a strain. But you also have a keen sense of the source and can try to fight it with your spirit.
1033:A flock of crows descends upon you, but they are not behaving naturally. {}{}{}{}They do not follow wind currents, instead moving through the sky like an ugly hammer, nor do they communicate with one another, instead flying in eerie silence. Their typically beady black eyes emit a dull white glow. {}{}{}{}You feel a curse take you even before they attack.
1034:The birds beat you badly and force you to flee, but strangely, they also wound your spirit. A heavy white light tangles your souls and does not let go easily.
1035:Whatever power holds these birds is strong and unrelenting. It burns deep into your soul, seeking to cleanse you of all that you are. {}{}{}{}You escape, but your spirit suffers. 
1036:You banish whatever force holds these crows. Some of the birds fall dead at your feet, while others fly away, confused. And some may want to stay with you.
1037:You defeat the odd birds, and as their bodies fall, some of them burn out from the inside, while others that survived look confused and dazed. And some may want to stay with you.{}{}
1038: You defeat the odd birds, and as their bodies fall, some of them burn out from the inside, while others that survived look confused and dazed. And some may want to stay with you.{}{}
1039:You notice that it is a flock of crows heading your way, but they are not behaving naturally. {}{}{}{}They do not follow wind currents, instead moving through the sky like an ugly hammer, nor do they communicate with one another, instead flying in eerie silence. Their typically beady black eyes emit a dull white glow. You feel an odd burning sensation from your domain, an unnatural pull towards the light.
1040:[Light]This is a perversion of your domain. Try to fight it off with willpower.
1041:You fall into an underground tunnel and realise it is a nest filled with bones, excrement, and rats, plenty of rats.
1042:Send in the cats and dogs to deal with this nuisance. 
1043:[Wisdom]You know a trick or two when it comes to rats. Chase them away.
1044:[Rat]Tell your fellow vermin that you're only here to say hi, and leave them be.
1045:Try to climb back up quickly.
1046:Whether you use a flute playing the right tune or the quiet whisper of the animal tongue, you chase the vermin away. {}{}{}{}You also find the remains of a lone adventurer holding a flute. Clearly, he did not know his rat tunes.
1047:You clear this nest and find the remains of a lone adventurer holding a flute. Clearly, he did not know his rat tunes.
1048:The rats swarm you and force you to flee.  You suffer a few infected bites on your way up.
1049:You notice a young rat stayed behind and is hovering nearby. Perhaps it could be trained, but it could also be rabid, and you'll get ill.
1050:Try to train it.
1051:Kill it and leave.
1052:The rats nod and let you leave without trouble. You even get a gift from them. 
1053:Your pets go in and do their business clearing the nest of vermin. 
1054:As you cross the plains, you spot a busy beehive full of honey and nectar. It could be very nutritious, perhaps even cure some wounds. 
1055:[Bee]Demand that the honey be given to you, now.
1056:[Druid]Ask the bees for the pleasure of their honey. 
1057:[Hunters and gatherers]You know how to smoke out these stingers so you can loot the hive.
1058:Go around the hive and leave.
1059:The bees back down and allow you to take a share of the spoils. {}{}{}{}Another younger bee, perhaps a queen to be, observes you with a spark of challenge in her eyes.
1060:Accept her challenge, bee to bee. [Queen bee only]
1061:Drink the nectar and honey. 
1062:The bees buzz around you as if assessing the sincerity of your words, and some sting you. But when they see you remain calm, they allow you to sample their goods.
1063:As the bees let their guard down, you can perform a ritual that will daze the stingers and allow you to rob their hive properly.
1064:You set up the trap and light the fires to create the smoke. Now you just need to figure out the right wind direction and time to spring your trap.
1065:Set the trap.
1066:Actually, just attack instead!
1067:As a druid, you feel dirty for betraying your nature so.{}{}{}{}Still, that's what you get for pairing up with a witch. The hive stands open for looting now, and you discover that the bees have hoarded some amber here. 
1068:Despite this being an unfair duel, you know the way of your kin is such. You won, so they honour you and give you gifts.
1069:Accept and leave.
1070:The hive stands open for looting now. The honey nectar heals your wounds, and you discover that the bees have hoarded some amber here. 
1071:The bees go into a frenzy and sting you badly. A heavy illness lingers as you run away.
1072:A swarm of bats descends upon you out of nowhere!
1073:[Turmoil]The sudden flush of excitement feeds your domain and makes your heart beat faster. Attack!
1074:[Night demon]Demand obedience from the flying rodents!
1075:[Perception]Stay still and allow them to fly past, even if it means taking a few scrapes. Try to spot exactly where they came from.
1076:The bats swarm you and feed on your blood, leaving some of you diseased. 
1077:You kill the bats without much trouble.
1078:[Perception]You scout the place where the bats came from.
1079:The bats fly past you, leaving some scratches, and you see a small, hidden entrance to a cave.
1080:You carefully sneak in and discover a rabid bear raging inside. A decent-looking weapon is lodged in its side, but the wound is old and not likely to slow its attack.
1081:You find the cave empty, although there are signs of something big passing through it -- likely what scared the bats. {}{}{}{}You find a stash of good stone.
1082:The bear is dead, and you can claim the weapon lodged in its side.
1083:You see a small, hidden entrance to a cave.
1084:The bats obey your night call and clear away.
1085:The bandits seem satisfied with free loot. They do not pursue.{}{}    
1086:You try running, but they are gaining on you fast.{}{}    
1087:Drop some of your bags and run away. 
1088:The orcs are dead, and their loot is yours.{}{}    
1089:The orcs take much of your belongings but leave you alive.{}{}    
1090:The matriarch watches you with an uncomfortable intensity.{}{}{}{}'You - you are so nasty-looking. I like it.{}{}{}{}Mate with me, and you will not regret it.'{}{}    
1091:Decline.
1092:You are ambushed by orc bandits!{}{}    
1093:[Orc]Growl a battle cry and charge!
1094:[Zorya]In Zorya's name, demand respect!
1095:Try to parley with them.
1096:'We are free from your tyranny, matriarch! We are the clanless, and we will never heel again!'{}{}{}{}They attack with greater ferocity!{}{}    
1097:'Argh... even out here, even though we're clanless, we still have honour. We bow to your rank, matriarch.'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, each dropping something as penance for their dishonour.{}{}    
1098:You see the orcs hesitate when you invoke Zorya's name.{}{}{}{}But you also know that your goddess is one of combat and valour, so they are unlikely to stop and talk on her account.{}{}    
1099:In the name of Zorya, attack them!
1100:Use this chance to flee.
1101:'Good tradin' with you. Fire in your hearts!'{}{}{}{}They walk off.{}{}    
1102:'We're not a charity, so drop some of your shit or get beaten.'{}{}    
1103:Say that you do not have enough for the fee. [Lose 10% equipment]
1104:'Your tongues wag well. Pay us a small fee, and we can trade with you.'{}{}    
1105:You are now painfully aware of orc mating rituals, yet you are also pleasantly surprised by the matriarch's predatory prowess.{}{}{}{}The bandits depart.{}{}    
1106:You are ambushed by grisly looking bandits who circle you like vultures:{}{}{}{}'So what do we have here? Healthy-looking bunch. Fetch us a good price.'
1107:Try to break through their lines and run away!
1108:Try reasoning with them. 
1109:Attempt to use your charm on them.
1110:You run away and leave the scoundrels behind.
1111:You kill the slavers and search for any captives, but you find that some people must have escaped during the fighting. {}{}{}{}Still, some may decide to join you.
1112:Search for anyone who may still be here, then leave.
1113:You barely get away, but not without bruises and having to abandon some bags.
1114:'Grown-ups make more trouble than they're worth. Stay down and thank your gods we're not in a killin' mood today.'
1115:Stay down and wait for them to leave.
1116:'Oi, this one will bring an extra good price. Yeah, yeah, fuck the young ones, let's take this one!'{}{}{}{}They draw in closer.
1117:'Your lucky day, pretty face. You're coming with us. The rest of you, stay down, or we'll skin you.'{}{}
1118:'Guess we've been known to do honest business of this. How about you sell us a kid, eh? We'll pay good gold and add this here mangy dog.'{}{}{}{}He points to a wolf by his side.
1119:Agree. [Lose one child]
1120:Decline and offer to pay them to go away.
1121:Use this distraction as an opportunity to make a run for it!
1122:Now that they don't expect it, attack!
1123:'Guess we've been a bit overburdened as it is. Tell ya what, how about you become customers instead? You pay us, we give you a child -- healthy, obedient, good as new.'{}{}
1124:Agree. Pay them first, then you will receive the child.
1125:You slaughter the slavers, and those who survived flee. {}{}{}{}Their cages look mostly empty, but maybe you can still find and free some folk.
1126:Search them, get what you can, and leave.
1127:'And we ain't in the kindly mood. We'll take ya by the skin, we will...'{}{}{}{}The slavers become agitated with excitement as they threaten you, and you have a slim chance to escape.
1128:You're ambushed by goblin bandits!{}{}    
1129:Agree to give up some of your things.  
1130:[Goblin]Try to parley with the bandits.
1131:[Magic or Intellect] In Marovit's name, and that of your domain, compel them to leave you alone.
1132:Try to talk them out of it.
1133:'Eh, me think it is never good to crap on your own. What can you offer?'{}{}    
1134:Use this distraction as an opportunity to attack!
1135:Offer to throw them a party with good food, drink, and rest to fuel them for future banditry.
1136:Convince them that the bandit life is unwise in the eyes of the goblin gonefathers.
1137:'Oh, why not, let us gobbos break bread. Here, have some herbs to make the party better.'{}{}    
1138:Party with the goblins.
1139:'Bah, why we care about your gods? Even if they're gobbos, we ain't bothered.{}{}{}{}Now shell out or get beat!'{}{}    
1140:[Magic user]Speak once again of Marovit's might, of his dominion over magic, of his power over nightmares and the spirit world.
1141:[Orc]Growl at them and say that if they don't respect Marovit, you will make them eat their own green guts.
1142:Agree to give up some of your things. 
1143:'Ah, you so right, man, we go do this thing, but we're not happy. {}{}{}{}You shame us. We go back to our tribe.'{}{}   {}{}Before they depart, they leave some of their stolen loot for you. 
1144:Invite them to eat and drink before they depart.
1145:Ask them to trade.
1146:The goblins nod and listen, then nod more...{}{}{}{}'Yeah, yeah, we bad, we go away now.'{}{}{}{}They leave, but you realise too late that they robbed you while you were talking!{}{}    
1147:Damn it.
1148:You kill the bandits and are free to loot their bodies.{}{}    
1149:A boar decides to stay with you. 
1150:The goblins beat you badly and take most of your bags of equipment. {}{}    
1151:'You show us good times, you show us wisdom. Our boar will stay and serve you for a bit. Be well, and may gonefathers watch over you.'{}{}    
1152:Bid them farewell.
1153:'Eh, maybe you're right, like. Yeah.{}{}{}{}We'll just go...'{}{}    
1154:Let them leave.
1155:'You fucking barbarian pigs! Always bullying us. Die!'{}{}    
1156:'Bah, you do talk so well. Our bandit code won't let us just leave, but if you give us some of your food, or stuff of your choosing, we will go and not bother you anymore.'{}{}{}{}Share some food and drink to mark this truce.
1157:Agree to give up some of your chosen things.  
1158:Agree to lose 10% of your food.
1159:'What, changed your minds, eh? We'll just take what we like, then!'{}{}    
1160:Lose some equipment.
1161:Go back to trade.
1162:A band of dwarven bandits stands in your way:{}{}{}{}'Halt! This bit of road here is ours, but you're in luck -- all we need today's your food. {}{}{}{}Drop it and yer free to go.'
1163:[Dwarf]Say that you will give up your food if they win a drinking contest.
1164:[Svarog] Assert your kinship with the dwarves through the lord of light.
1165:In the name of light and turmoil, attack the dishonourable dwarves.
1166:They don't seem too committed to this. Try talking them out of it.
1167:[Bandit]Question their bandit ways if all they take is food.
1168:Give up the food.
1169:'Aye, I see the mark of the great blacksmith upon you. Shite land on my head if I care for that shit. {}{}{}{}You give us the food, laddies, or get a beatin', Svarog or no Svarog.'
1170:'Haugh... yes, you are one tough son of the stone!'{}{}{}{}The other bandits nod in agreement, pat you on the back, and let you be on your way.{}{}{}{}'Aye, I see the mark of the great blacksmith god upon you. Shite. We'd rather eat dirt than dishonour one human-god who knows his smithing.'{}{}
1171:'Bah, ya drink well, but not well enough, eh? Ha!{}{}{}{}Deal's a deal, so we'll have some of that food before ya be on your way, laddies.'
1172:Leave the food and go.
1173:You kill the bandits and take their loot. 
1174:The bandits beat you badly and take your food and equipment, but at least they leave you breathing.
1175:'Aye, ya got us. We ain't cut out to be beatin' folk for no reason. We're banished, but we still have our honour. Thank ya for reminding us.{}{}{}{}If you like, we'll trade with ya, eh?'{}{}{}{}The dwarves also leave a small gift in thanks.
1176:Agree to trade.
1177:Talk, drink, and leave.
1178:'Enough talkin' - we're takin the food, now!'
1179:'Hold on there, laddie, what in the bearded sage's sake gives you the right to judge? We do our banditin' as we bloody well like!'
1180:Assert that it is certainly not the right way and that you can in fact school them, for a fee.
1181:'Aye, I see the mark of the great blacksmith upon you. Shite. We'd rather eat dirt than dishonour one human who knows his smithing.'{}{}{}{}
1182:Say that Svarog is the god of fires and light, not a human.
1183:Say that you will give them some food.
1184:Nod and leave.
1185:'Oi, don't get yer undies in a twist, story goes that he was once human, that's all I am sayin'.'{}{}
1186:'Ah, the shame of it all! I spit on those blasted light-wraiths five times over for taking our homes and forcin' us into a life like this.'{}{}{}{}They accept your gift with humility and leave a small token of their thanks in exchange.
1187:Ask more about the light-wraiths.
1188:'No idea, laddies, no idea. Came when the sun was as bright as ever and scorched our small hamlet, that they did. Took some of our kin, put a strange kind of spell on them. Others just burned from inside and died when the wraiths touched them.{}{}{}{}Nasty business, I tell ya. So we ran, and we're banished now.'
1189:Ask them where their hamlet used to be. Maybe you'll investigate one day.
1190:'Ya make a bloody good point there, laddie. We ain't used to this. We were honest folk till our homes got burnt and, well, we are banished now, and banditry's our lot. {}{}{}{}Here, take this payment, and teach us to do it right!'
1191:Nod and teach them the ways of assertiveness, intimidation, and brutality.
1192:'Yeah, yeah, right you are, too soft -- that's what we've been! {}{}{}{}The food, now!'
1193:'Nothin left of it now, but be wary -- you may come across those light-wraiths if you go that way.'{}{}
1194:You are ambushed by elven bandits!
1195:[Elf] Remind them of ancient elven laws that forbid doing harm to one another.
1196:[Leshy]Call the elves to heel. They are children of the forest and should bow to you!
1197:[Beautiful]Flutter your eyelashes like crazy. 
1198:Abandon some of your packs and run for it.
1199:Try reasoning with the bandits.
1200:'This world has shattered many ancient laws. Our woodland was tarnished by the human blight, burned, harvested, and left in tatters. {}{}{}{}We now take what we desire from those who are weak. It is... refreshing.'
1201:Insist that this is not the way of harmony nor the path of light and nature, all of which they should respect!
1202:Scorn them for losing honour and soul for greed. 
1203:Agree to give them some food, but nothing more. 
1204:Use this opportunity to try talking sense into them.
1205:You abandon the packs, but the elves fire a few arrows at you.{}{}
1206:You kill the elves.
1207:The elven bandits beat you badly and take some of your belongings. Luckily, they leave you alive.
1208:'Perhaps we can come to a more amicable arrangement. We may have strayed from our path thus far, yet it is no reason to abandon all civility.{}{}{}{}You will pay us a small fee, and in exchange, you may trade with us.'
1209:Agree to the fee and trade.
1210:Change your mind and attack!
1211:'The offer has now expired. We shall take a reasonable ransom but leave you intact. I advise you to take this offering.'
1212:Agree and lose some items.
1213:'Your words are as empty as our souls, and your wits as dull as a mortal's life.'{}{}{}{}The elves disappear into the woods, and you realise they robbed you blind!
1214:Try to catch them!
1215:'You shame us. For the child deities to look down upon us with such righteous disdain... This is painful.{}{}{}{}You have not broken our laws, you have not trespassed on our sacred land, yet we seek violence like common orcs.'
1216:Tell them it is time to return to the right path.
1217:You see great despair in their eyes. Some simply drop their weapons to the ground and walk off. {}{}
1218:Gather what they left and leave.
1219:'We thank thee, brethren, for you have restored harmony to our lost souls. {}{}{}{}We must now find our way back to the light. May the grace of your pantheon fall upon you.'{}{}{}{}The elves leave you a gift and depart.
1220:Bid them farewell. 
1221:The elven bandits waver in their violent resolve. They nod in agreement.{}{}
1222:The elves are mesmerized by your beauty. {}{}
1223:They are distracted - attack!
1224:The elves stop in their tracks, taken aback by your strong words.
1225:They are distracted -- attack!
1226:'Your beauty soothed our souls and reminded us of the folly of our ways, for this life may be fleeting and wrought with despair, yet such delicate flowers endure and bloom in the dirt. We thank thee.'{}{}{}{}The elves leave you a gift and depart.
1227:Instead of inspiring change, you have broken their spirit. You see great despair in their eyes. Some simply drop their weapons to the ground and walk off. {}{}{}{}You feel the weight of their despair fall upon you, and this failure cuts your elven soul deeply.{}{}{}{}But they do leave you alone.{}{}
1228:You are ambushed by a band of crazed scavengers, clearly driven to take more risk than usual.
1229:Stand firm and intimidate them with your brawny muscle.
1230:Drop some of your equipment and run away.
1231:You face them head on, raise your weapons, and flex your muscles.{}{}{}{}The scavengers look very unsure of themselves now. Some even leave.
1232:Use this chance to attack them.
1233:Convince them it is best if they leave, now.
1234:The scavengers beat you badly, and you barely escape their savagery as they try to rip anything you have off you.
1235:'Right, right, right, you big, big, scary, we leave you, leave you, yeah, look, we leave our things, you take, you go, you leave us be...'{}{}{}{}They back away and even drop some things.
1236:Leave. 
1237:Use this opportunity to attack a smaller pack!
1238:'You give us your stuff, give it, give it, give it!'{}{}{}{}While they talk, you use the opportunity to run from the crazed pack, but not without losing a few bags. 
1239:You barely got away, not without bruises and not without losing a few bags. 
1240:You run away without trouble. 
1241:You defeat the scavengers.
1242:Your camp is besieged by a group of humanoids lurking in the darkness. {}{}{}{}'Keep calm and we shall all get what we want tonight.'
1243:Stay calm and listen to what they have to say.
1244:[Night demons]Tell the strigas to come out and speak plainly.
1245:The night demons take your blood, but as agreed, not enough to kill you. {}{}{}{}You may suffer weakness from this, but they leave you be.
1246:The lesser strigas shudder and step back. The other one speaks from the dark again:{}{}{}{}'Such malice from one of our own. How sad. We leave you be, then, servants of light...'
1247:Apologise for the outburst and ask what exchange he meant earlier.
1248:You run away, but not without severe blood loss. The creatures were fast and agile in their feasting. 
1249:You kill the strigas and loot their bodies.
1250:The strigas assault you angrily after you fail to comply with their demands. {}{}{}{}You hear whispers of 'Horz's pack' and, despite their threats, they do not drain you to death.
1251:A figure steps into the light for only the briefest moment. He is tall, foreboding, and bestially alluring. {}{}{}{}'You will give us some of your blood, and we will not harm you beyond that. Resist, and we shall devour you whole.'{}{}{}{}He steps back into darkness, and his minions step forwards, baring their fangs.
1252:Assert that you are no mere traveller, but a servant of the pantheon who are Horz's pack after all, so they should step away.
1253:Agree to give some blood.
1254:A figure steps into the light for only the briefest moment. He is tall, foreboding, and bestially alluring. {}{}{}{}'Ah, a fellow night walker. Hmm, perhaps we can make this exchange even more civil, then?'
1255:Ask what exchange.
1256:Tell him to back off or die.
1257:[Light] In the name of Light, tell the striga to leave.
1258:'I concluded that my cattle are wearing thin. First darkness spoilt the lot, and now this wretched Shattering with its light-wraiths is destroying your fragile societies.'
1259:Nod and listen.
1260:'And so, I have decided a measured approach is more sustainable. I have trained my feral pack to obey. {}{}{}{}We ambush warm-blooded folk, taking only the blood we need. We feast on their flesh only if they resist - leaving it up to fate, if you will.'
1261:Beautiful and female] Approve of their practical approach and state that your own ways have become tame to help you survive with people.
1262:Question the truth of his words.
1263:[Horz]Affirm that Horz would approve of such measured control.
1264:[Night demon] Approve of their practical approach and state that your own ways have become tame to help you survive with people.
1265:'Yes, you smell of the human gods. The lord of night is our master too, of course.{}{}{}{}So how about you let us have some blood, and perhaps some meat, if you have any? And we will offer a trade.'
1266:Agree to give blood and trade.
1267:Decline giving blood, but part on good terms.
1268:'Think what you like, but from what I smell, you too follow a less savage way, for you serve the human pantheon. {}{}{}{}The lord of night is our master too, of course. In that, at least, we can find common ground.{}{}{}{}So how about you let us have some blood, and perhaps some meat, if you have any? And we will offer a trade.'
1269:'As you wish. May the moon strengthen you.'{}{}{}{}The strigas disappear into the night, and you feel the night lord's blessing upon you.
1270:'Such raw, bestial power in your words. Such beauty in your every move.{}{}{}{}I will be yours to command if you let me taste you, just once...' 
1271:Decline and tell him to leave. 
1272:'You taste like the moon itself. Clearly you serve our master's pack. {}{}{}{}Until we meet again, my love...'{}{}{}{}You feel changed by the embrace of the striga master. You feel his presence at every full moon from now on.
1273:Bid him farewell and leave.
1274:'You taste like the moon itself. Clearly you serve our master's pack. {}{}{}{}I will follow that path also. My servant will keep you safe until we meet again, my love...'
1275:'As you wish...'{}{}{}{}The striga disappear, but you feel watched at every full moon thereafter.
1276:The strigas listen to your words and back away quietly into the night.
1277:You are ambushed by bandits:{}{}{}{}'Your goods or your lives!'
1278:[Bandit]Suggest a fair trade instead, with you throwing in a bit extra -- less risk for both parties. 
1279:[Attractive] Give the captain your best smile.
1280:Try to parley with them. 
1281:'Heh, I guess it won't do us no harm, so why not?'
1282:'Huh, yeah, well, I mean, you're kind of cute, so what do you have in mind? I mean, if you fancy a little time to ourselves on the side, my men will leave you be, sure.'
1283:Agree to go with the captain.
1284:Play the damsel in distress who does not want to succumb to such base behaviours. 
1285:Say that perhaps one day you might, but for now how about the two of you just trade goods instead of spilling blood?
1286:'Well, I guess I can be convinced to let you pay a smaller fee, and we can even do some trading. Best I can do.'
1287:Agree to the trade.
1288:You manage to run, but not without bruises and lost bags as the bandits chase you.
1289:You kill the bandits and loot their bodies when you discover not only that one is still alive, but it is a child of yours that was once lost to the bandit trials. {}{}{}{}They plead with you to take them back, saying the bandits made them stay.
1290:Take the youth with you.
1291:Among other things, you find a treasure map.
1292:Take it.
1293:You are beaten badly and forced to flee to tend to your poisoned wounds. 
1294:'What, no tradin'? In that case, we will take a bit of what we like and let you go scot-free, deal?'
1295:'Oh, right, yes, I mean no, I'd never! Well, here, this is for you and maybe, you know, maybe we could find each other sometime soon, go out for a dinner?'
1296:Smile, nod, take his stuff, and leave.
1297:'Oh, right, yes, I mean, will you promise to see me again soon?{}{}{}{}Anyway, for banditry's sake, I can't just let you go. I mean, my reputation and all. {}{}{}{}But you pay us extra and we'll trade. This way we're both happy. Well, sort of -- I'd be happier if you came to the side with me.'
1298:Smile and agree to the trade.
1299:'Sorry, babe, but you gotta pay up, or I gotta do my rough thing. We'll take some of those bags of yours and you can go, just 'cause your pretty face... made my day shine and all.'{}{}{}{}He looks slightly embarrassed, and his men snicker at him. 
1300:Give away the stuff.
1301:You go into some tall shrubbery, and the captain makes sure the men are out of sight:{}{}{}{}'Right, listen, I have a reputation, you know, one has to be the alpha in these packs. But I ain't no rapey person. So if you like, we can just sit here, moan a bit, pretend we did the deed, and part ways.'
1302:Kiss the captain passionately and have some fun.
1303:Say you appreciate the candour, and play pretend as he said.
1304:'Bit awkward, isn't it... tell ya what, want to trade while we sit here?' {}{}
1305:Decline, wait out the appropriate time for the ruse to work, and leave.
1306:The captain returns to the crew, looking pleased and raunchy. They make some crude jokes, but they walk away as promised.
1307:The captain is pleasantly taken aback by your advances and willingly lets you take charge. You spend a passionate hour together until the bored bandits start to complain loudly. {}{}{}{}The captain turns to you.{}{}{}{}'Well, as promised, you're free to go... and, eh, maybe we'll meet again, soon?'
1308:Say that it was nice, but it was a one-time thing only.
1309:[Beautiful] Say that you hope so as well.
1310:Say that you hope so as well.
1311:The captain nods, his face saddened.{}{}{}{}The bandits depart as promised, and you find a small gift left for you.
1312:You are about to part ways when the captain turns to you:{}{}{}{}'I cannot leave. You, you are like a ray of sunshine gleaming onto precious gems, making them even prettier, making everything better! I will stay by your side, so help me the gods.'{}{}
1313:Leave together.
1314:'You have the gift of the gab, I'll give you that, but I am not buying it, pretty. Shell out or take a beating.?
1315:Allow the bandits to take some of your things.
1316:You are about to part ways when the captain turns to you:{}{}{}{}'I just can't get you out my head, pretty. What say you to comin' with us? Can't offer much, but we'll have us some good fun and sharp eyes here, they always wanted to stay, settle down, so you'll get them to do that good work of yours, a swap, eh?'{}{}
1317:Agree to the switch. Run into the captain's arms and walk off towards your new adventure.
1318:The captain nods, his face saddened.{}{}{}{}The bandits depart as promised, and you find a small gift left for you, carried by a faithful dog.
1319:'Sorry, mate, but you gotta pay up, or I gotta do my rough thing. We'll take some of those bags of yours now.'{}{}
1320:You never did see your lover boy again, but some months later, as your child arrives, you realise that you will never forget the scoundrel.
1321:Celebrate.
1322:You kill the bandits and loot their bodies. 
1323:Gather what you find.
1324:You see an orc female approaching with a child.{}{}{}{}'Ah you, the god followers. I come with a message from my sister, who bedded one of you several months ago.'{}{}    
1325:Say that the one who mated with the orc is not here.
1326:Acknowledge that it was you.
1327:'I do not care. My sister sent me to show you the pup. It is custom that the father or his kin should bless it.'{}{}    
1328:[Orc]Give the father blessing and ask what gender the child is.
1329:The orc shows you an orc child, grown far beyond what you'd expect from its age.{}{}{}{}You make the gesture of a blessing, as directed by the female. She nods:{}{}{}{}'Good.'{}{}    
1330:Ask what happens now.
1331:'Now you take the brat and do with it as you like. Its mongrel blood would have served well, but it looks too human and likely may turn out male.{}{}{}{}We have no use for such a pup.{}{}{}{}Fire and steel!'{}{}    
1332:Fire and steel.
1333:'A mongrel child she may be, but she is a girl, so she will be a sister. Who knows, she may prove your blood proud one day.{}{}{}{}And for this, we bring you the father-price. It is custom. Take it.{}{}{}{}Fire and steel!'{}{}    
1334:Object and fight for the child!
1335:'Although it is strangely unclear still, the mongrel is most likely a boy, so you will take him now.'{}{}{}{}She hands you the child and walks off.{}{}    
1336:Nod in agreement, as is custom.
1337:'It is a strong girl. She will make her mother proud and thus the father's blood will bring honour to our clan.{}{}{}{}Take this father-price as a mark of a father's duty done well.{}{}{}{}Fire and steel!'{}{}    
1338:'Customs must be obeyed. You will risk the child's life in combat?'{}{}{}{}She gestures to the child she carries, showing no signs of cutting it down for combat.{}{}    
1339:Let her go.
1340:[Magic and Magic user] The unnatural forces binding these unliving are still weak. Try to break this bond and thus free their souls.
1341:The funeral pyres burn high, and you utter the guttural charge command so the souls of the fallen may rise up in their final call to battle. {}{}{}{}Your spirits are lifted as you feel the presence of the fallen now at peace. 
1342:The funeral pyres burn high, and you utter the guttural charge command so the souls of the fallen may rise up in their final call to battle. 
1343:You bury the bodies according to your custom, but alas, the air is heavy with the unrest of the spirits, and your own souls feel burdened by it. {}{}
1344:You bury the bodies according to your custom, but perhaps the fallen orcs did not like it, as they rise up to attack you!
1345:[Unliving]Speak to your unliving kin to calm their anger and offer aid.
1346:[Nature or Harmony] As nature and harmony sway your soul, use your domain to weaken these unliving before killing them for good!
1347:Before you can take your treasure, you hear an orc warrior bellowing at you:{}{}{}{}'We claim this ruin as our turf, as marked by our fallen kin!'{}{}
1348:You help dig out the bodies and make proper funeral pyres in accordance with orc customs.{}{}{}{}The orcs appreciate your aid and add some metals as reward before they bid you farewell.{}{}
1349:You gather up what little is left in the ruins, but you hear footsteps behind you and see some of the unliving rising!
1350:Take only the loot you found in the ruins, and leave the orcs be.{}
1351:You track down the scoundrels who absconded with your kin!
1352:[Turmoil]Charge!
1353:[Harmony]Speak to them, as peace is always preferable.
1354:[Intellect]Observe them and find an advantage.
1355:[Light]In the name of justice, smite them now!
1356:[Nature and magic]Take time to investigate. Perhaps you will find an angle here.
1357:You kill the scum and rescue your kin, along with any other loot they may have had.
1358:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. Your kidnapped folk is lost for good.
1359:'Bah, stop yammering about your bloody gods already. Leave or die!'
1360:'Bah, stop yammering about your bloody gods already. Fine, have the pretty face back. Just go!'{}{}
1361:You watch their camp, note their patterns, and overhear that they are searching for metals, especially gold. They might be open to trading.
1362:Try to convince them to trade.
1363:[Hunter]Attack, but sneak up on them and set a trap to make the fight easier.
1364:You do not have enough gold to make deals. Attack!
1365:[Bandit]Approach them as a friend and offer to trade food for the child.
1366:'Bah, you're a clever one, ain't ya? Fine, we do like gold, and we'd rather not get into a scrap if we can avoid it.'{}{}
1367:Attack instead!
1368:The bandits do as they promised and give your kin back.{}{}
1369:You watch their camp, note their patterns, and notice they are looking rather worse for wear when it comes to food and drink. They might be open to trading.
1370:Try to trade with them for food.
1371:You do not have enough food to make deals. Attack!
1372:As you fall asleep at your campsite, your dreams become heavy and unsettling. As you toss and turn, you feel more and more unsettled as your deepest, darkest fears become real and hold you trapped within the nightmare.
1373:Try to wake up.
1374:You slowly wake and in the state of half-waking, you see mares sitting on your chests, siphoning your spirits.{}{}{}{}As soon as you regain full consciousness, the demons are gone, but you still feel a deep chill run down your spines.
1375:Get it together and move on.
1376:You try to wake and in the state of half-waking, you see mares sitting on your chests, siphoning your spirits.{}{}{}{}The surge of panic feeds the demons and you fall back into tormented slumber, knowing they will have their way.{}{}{}{}When morning comes, you are released, but you are wrecked and exhausted.
1377:You try to wake and in the state of half-waking, you see mares sitting on your chests, siphoning your spirits.{}{}{}{}The surge of panic feeds the demons and you fall back into tormented slumber, knowing they will have their way.{}{}{}{}For one of you, this night will be the last in the realms of mortal flesh.
1378:As you sit by the campfire, some of the sparks from the flame begin to dance in the air. They move away from the bonfire and become glimmers in the night. {}{}{}{}They seem to want you to follow them somewhere.
1379:Follow the glimmers.
1380:Stay put.
1381:You follow the glimmers for a short while and find yourself unexpectedly stuck in a bog!{}{}{}{}The lights turned out to be flickers, mischievous little buggers always looking for a chance to lead people astray.{}{}{}{}You get out, but you're tired and catch a cold.
1382:Get back to camp.
1383:The glimmers lead you to an old crypt.
1384:Say a prayer to Nyia, the goddess of death, for the souls to be at rest. Then search this place.
1385:The glimmers guide you to a path that is not only abundant in fruit, but also may prove a useful shortcut on your journey onwards. {}{}
1386:Your prayer does not satisfy the angered spirits that dwell here still. {}{}{}{}The wraiths slowly materialise before you, seeking to take your souls.
1387:[Goblin Shaman or Wraith]Convince the wraiths to allow you to set them free.
1388:[Magic users]Battle the wraiths with your spirit.
1389:Get back to camp -- this seems too dangerous.
1390:You defeat the wraiths and they dissolve into nothingness. A few linger and some may even stay with you, but they now pose no danger.{}{}{}{}You're free to search this site in peace.
1391:You are defeated and feel your spirit weaken as you are forced to flee.
1392:Run back to your camp.
1393:Your prayer clearly appeased the spirits here, as you feel the air lighten and sense the passing of trapped souls. There is a chance one such soul may join you.{}{}{}{}You are free to search this site now.
1394:The wraiths stop and nod in agreement. You perform the prayer to Nyia once more and this time, the power of the goddess flows through you and engulfs the spirits in its dark, empty embrace.{}{}{}{}A few linger and some may even stay with you, but they now pose no danger.
1395:As you clear the land to make a better campsite, you uncover a heavy ironclad chest, likely unearthed here by the Shattering. It is bound in chains and has some odd foreign symbols on it.
1396:[Runemaster]These are no symbols, they are ancient runes -- not dwarven, but certainly trying to imitate your kin's craft. Try to decipher these runes.
1397:[Wraith]You sense a fellow wraith trapped within this object. Take a closer look. 
1398:[Magic user or Magic]Strong magic resides in this object. If you are to set up camp here, you'd better deal with it first. Take a closer look.
1399:[Wisdom]Try to figure out what this writing may mean.
1400:Open the chest.
1401:Leave it be and set up camp a bit farther away.
1402:You remove the chains, but the chest remains closed. You hear a slow, malicious hissing. 
1403:Attempt to carefully extract whatever is inside without further damaging the chest and hopefully before the hissing gets worse.
1404:Try to smash it quickly and grab what you can before whatever is hissing comes your way.
1405:These runes are meant to work as protection for whatever lies within the chest. They are binding runes, so opening the chest will release the guardians -- most likely, wraiths. {}{}{}{}The chains work as a trigger. When broken, they will begin the process of releasing the wraiths.
1406:Despite the magic protection, the chest is very old and has many weak spots. Try to open the chest without breaking the chains.
1407:Now that you know what this is, try to perform a cleansing ritual to release the wraiths, thus making it safe to open the chest.
1408:[Wraith]Remove the chains and speak to your kind to calm them. Convince them that they don't need to follow whatever force bound them here. Instead, they can be free!
1409:You carefully chip away at the side of the chest and create an opening without touching the chains or breaking the runes. {}{}
1410:Grab what you can and leave. 
1411:You carefully chip away at the side of the chest and create an opening. Alas, you accidentally break one of the runes, and the chains break without you even touching them. {}{}{}{}Wraiths appear and descend upon you!{}{}
1412:[Wraith]Speak to your kind to calm them. Convince them that they don't need to follow whatever force bound them here. Instead, they can be free!
1413:Abandon the chest and try to flee.
1414:You smash the chest, and a pack of angered wraiths appears before you and attacks!
1415:Attack them with your willpower.
1416:Grab what you can and run for it. 
1417:The wraiths are no more, and now you are free to loot the chest safely.
1418:Gather what is inside and leave.
1419:You try to carefully extract whatever is in the chest without doing further damage, but you fail. The thing shatters in your hands, releasing a pack of angered wraiths before you!
1420:You smash the chest and can grab some loot quickly. {}{}{}{}But you see a pack of angered wraiths forming before you.
1421:You carefully break away the side of the chest without causing further damage, and you grab some of the stuff from the inside. {}{}{}{}The hissing gets louder, however, and you see wraiths forming before you.{}{}
1422:The ancient protection spell proved too powerful for you. The wraiths assault your spirit and force you to flee before you are lost entirely.
1423:These runes are meant to work as protection for whatever lies within the chest. They are binding runes, so opening the chest will release the guardians -- most likely, wraiths. {}{}{}{}The chains work as a trigger. When broken, they will begin the process of releasing the wraiths.{}{}{}{}Luckily, you know how to break the protection safely.
1424:Open the chest and take what is inside.
1425:'Yes, thank you! We are free now... or can we follow you, perhaps?'{}{}{}{}An argument ensues among the wraiths. Most disappear, but some may choose to stay with you instead. {}{}{}{}You are free to loot the chest safely now.
1426:The wraiths listen. Some look interested, but others are too far gone, angry and bewildered by centuries of captivity. The two groups fight among each other. You feel your own spirit assaulted and you are forced to flee.
1427:The ritual worked, and the wraiths are free of their bonds. The chest is now safe for looting. {}{}
1428:You are rudely awakened by a rabble of folk slowly descending upon your campsite. At first, they seem like mere bandits, but you see their eyes are bloodshot, their faces twisted in an angry grimace, and their mouths foaming. 
1429:[Scavenger]Take a closer look.
1430:[Harmony and intellect]They seem ailing, yet still human. Perhaps there is a way to help them rather than kill them. Try capturing them alive.
1431:Take a risk and find another way to deal with them.
1432:Grab whatever you can in haste and run away.
1433:You kill all the scavengers. Their bodies are covered with boils and seeping with odd green ooze. {}{}
1434:Get what you can off them safely and leave.
1435:Investigate the bodies.
1436:Bury the bodies and leave.
1437:The scavengers overwhelm you and force you to flee, abandoning some of your goods. {}{}{}{}You also feel sick afterwards. They must have infected you with something.
1438:The scavengers lie dead. You were lucky enough not to get infected by their strange illness. {}{}{}{}A couple of their pets may want to tag along with you, but they may be infected.
1439:Take the pets.
1440:Kill the pets to be safe.
1441:The scabs and boils are so bad that these folks should have died long before now. You suspect an unnatural illness, and thus you know the bodies must be decapitated, hands and feet bound, and then burned to make sure they stay dead.
1442:Perform the special rite and leave.
1443:They are your kin, but far gone with the dark sickness, a remnant of the age of darkness past. If you could capture them, perhaps they could yet be cured, as you have been by following the gods. {}{}{}{}But beware -- their madness is more than mental, for they spread toxin and disease too.
1444:Try capturing them.
1445:Lure them into a trap.
1446:They seem ailing, yet still human. Perhaps there is a way to help them rather than kill them.
1447:Try capturing them by force.
1448:You capture the scavengers safely and, indeed, you find they are feverish and sick. {}{}
1449:[Medic]Use medicine to help them out.
1450:[Magic user]This illness reeks of darkness. Prepare a ritual to try to cleanse their minds.
1451:[Light]Your domain can ease their pain.
1452:[Elf]You have witnessed this dark taint upon your own kind as well. Use your spirit and your connection to the light to help them.
1453:Do your best to help them out. Use your connection to the gods to try to light their dark path.
1454:Not all minds and bodies are strong enough to survive this taint, and even with your help, some of the victims pass away. {}{}{}{}But others show signs of recovery, or at least improvement. They regain some semblance of their mind and are thankful for your aid. {}{}{}{}Perhaps some will choose to stay with you. Even if they do not, they leave what they can in thanks.
1455:Light surges through the ailing bodies and decayed souls, and you feel them slowly healing. {}{}{}{}For some, the journey may yet prove too much. But you have given them a chance. The scavengers regain some semblance of their mind and are thankful for your aid. {}{}{}{}Perhaps some will choose to stay with you. Even if they do not, they leave what they can in thanks.
1456:Some of the disease spreads to you, but nothing life-threatening. {}{}{}{}You do your best to help, but most of the victims are too far gone and die. The few who survive show signs of recovery, or at least improvement. They regain some semblance of their mind and are thankful for your aid. {}{}{}{}Perhaps some will choose to stay with you. Even if they do not, they leave what they can in thanks.
1457:Some of the disease spreads to you, but nothing life-threatening. You do your best to help, but the victims are too far gone and die. You know that you have made their deaths more peaceful at the very least, and for that, you feel relief.  {}{}
1458:Some of the disease spreads to you, and you fail to properly capture the scavengers. Many run away, and those you catch are too far gone to be helped, and die.{}{}
1459:As you set up camp at night, you hear the howling of wolves around you. Some of it is worryingly guttural, almost manlike.
1460:[Night demon]Call out into the night.
1461:[Horz]Demand obedience from these night hunters in the name of the moon lord himself.
1462:[Hunter]Listen to the howls; there seems to be more happening here than an attack.
1463:[Wisdom]You have some silver. Use it to create a protective circle.
1464:Gather your things quickly and try to run.
1465:The pack bows down in respect of the night lord. One of the lesser wolves considers staying with you.{}{}{}{}A lone werewolf walks into view. He is holding his side and you see a silver dagger lodged in it. He collapses before you.{}{}
1466:Take the dagger out and try to help him.
1467:Let him die and loot the body after. 
1468:You slay the beasts and their bodies shift to human form. A stray wolf, now without a pack, stays to follow you.
1469:The werewolves are agitated by your efforts and charge!
1470:Defend.
1471:One of us will stay behind and sacrifice their life to save the rest!
1472:Leave one child behind, and maybe they will let the rest of us go!
1473:The pack retreats, leaving you to help the wounded werewolf. {}{}{}{}It has a silver blade lodged in its side, and the wound is festering with an odd taint. 
1474:Help the werewolf.
1475:Leave it to die.
1476:The brave soul charges the pack of werewolves. The creatures respect the warrior's honour and do not chase the rest of you.
1477:You leave the crying child behind and run.
1478:Your brave friend returns to you, changed, but ever loyal!
1479:Great, welcome them.
1480:The werewolves seem even more infuriated by your barbaric ways and they attack viciously, growling: {}{}{}{}'Filthy beasts, sacrificing your own young!'{}{}{}{}You run, but not without getting mauled badly.
1481:You run away, but many moons later, a wolf -- one of the children -- comes back to its home, and despite your abandonment, wants to stay with you.
1482:The howling quiets, and a lone werewolf walks into view. He is holding his side, and you see a silver dagger lodged in it. He collapses before you.
1483:You hear the wolves circling you, but they do not attack. {}{}{}{}The pack is clearly angered, yet also desperate. As you observe, you notice a werewolf among them, wounded, perhaps dying, yet still distrustful of your presence.
1484:Stay safe within the silver circle and wait for them to leave.
1485:[Animal kinship]Try to show that you wish to help the wounded beast. 
1486:These are no mere beasts, yet they are still guided by instinct. The werewolf is wounded, and the pack seeks help. Try to convince them that you mean no harm and will try to aid them by throwing away some silver - a gesture of good will.
1487:You remain within the circle, and eventually the pack skulks away into the darkness. It was a restless night, but your resolve strengthens.
1488:The werewolf pack respects that you yield to their power, and they leave you be without any further harm. 
1489:The dagger proves more than just silver. It was clearly cursed, as it turns to ash when you take it out. You are struck by remnants of a spell, but no curse lingers on you.{}{}{}{}Your healer tends to the wounds. The werewolf should recover in no time.
1490:Good. Leave him for the pack to reclaim.
1491:The pack howls in thanks, and you find a stash left for you as a reward.
1492:The dagger proves more than just silver. It was clearly cursed, as it turns to ash when you take it out. You are struck by remnants of a spell, and a curse lingers upon you too.{}{}{}{}You do your best with the creature's wounds. The werewolf should recover in time.
1493:The dagger proves more than just silver. It was clearly cursed, as it turns to ash when you take it out. You are struck by remnants of a spell, but no curse lingers on you.{}{}{}{}You do your best with the creature's wounds. The werewolf should recover in time.
1494:You wait until the werewolf dies. The pack howls in the darkness from despair, but for some reason they do not attack you.{}{}{}{}You soon discover that the dagger that was lodged in the werewolf's side was in fact cursed, and some of its ill effects may reach you.
1495:The pack snarls and paces around you, not willing to trust a stranger. {}{}{}{}You do, however, have a window to escape now.
1496:You are strong and agile, so you outrun the wolves, although it is exhausting.
1497:You outrun the wolves, although it is exhausting.
1498:You outrun the wolves, although it is exhausting, and you have to drop some bags on the way.
1499:You are badly beaten and forced to flee and when the next full moon rises, you realise you were cursed to walk as a creature of the night!
1500:You see a point of interest ahead.
1501:You take cover in the cave, but you soon realise you are not alone. A set of hungry wolf eyes is staring at you, and more wolves are sleeping inside.
1502:[Beast] As a beast of the wild yourself, dominate the wolves into submission.
1503:[Beast master/Druid]Mark your territory and intimidate the wolves into backing down.
1504:You feel the influence of turmoil and nature, and you know you must dominate these wolves as an alpha would. Only the strongest may lead.
1505:You kill the wolves and you're free to take shelter in the cave. {}{}{}{}You even discover a small amount of good stone within.
1506:You beat the wolves. The rest of the pack submits to your dominance and leaves. 
1507:The wolves beat you badly and chase you away from their turf. 
1508:You come across an old cave, its entrance revealed in a recent shattering.
1509:Check the cave.
1510:Within the cave, you see scattered bones of the fallen lying before an open arch. Beyond it, you spot a shrine of some sort. {}{}{}{}The skeletal remains are clad in different clothing and equipment, and some are older than others, suggesting that more than one party attempted to enter this place.
1511:[Magic user or mysticism] Whatever killed these folk smells of magic, so remain vigilant.
1512:Go in closer to search the place.
1513:Remove the bones first and give them a proper burial. 
1514:You sense the very strong presence of dark magic -- necromancy. The power seeks to control the unliving bodies for its own unclean purposes. {}{}{}{}The shrine within, however, seems to honour the goddess Nyia. The presence of necromancy in her place of worship is blasphemy. {}{}
1515:Face the unliving fiends in a battle of the spirits to destroy their master's hold.
1516:[Magic user] Perform a ritual of cleansing that may allow you to shield this place from the necromancer's power.
1517:Place protective wards, but face the unliving head on. It may not cleanse the place forever, but it will do the job for now. Attack!
1518:The unliving lie still, the dark bonds released, and the necromancer's power diminished.{}{}{}{}The arch leading to the shrine shimmers with a blue light, and you know you may now enter.
1519:Enter the shrine.
1520:Whatever holds these unliving here is too strong for you. The unliving swarm you, forcing you to flee, but as you leave, the cave's entrance collapses, so they cannot chase you. It is as if the gods protected you as you left.
1521:You search the bones and approach the arched portal, but a force unseen prevents you from entering. {}{}{}{}The air stirs, and before you, the skeletons rise and attack!
1522:You gather the bones for burial, but you realise too late that a dark curse binds the spirits to the dead bodies, and now the angered wraiths lash out at you!
1523:As the chosen of Nyia, you feel her satisfaction as you perform the correct rites to honour death.{}{}{}{}The bodies lie still, and you may now enter the shrine hidden deep within the cave.
1524:You feel good about your deed, and you are left to gather whatever the unliving carried with them.{}{}
1525:Enter the shrine within the cave.
1526:You realise that when you burned the remains, the cave's entrance shook and collapsed. Gather up the loot from the dead and rubble from the cave and leave.
1527:The skeletons lie still once more. Whatever foul magic animated them seems to have drained away for now. {}{}{}{}The arch leading to the shrine shimmers with a blue light and you know you may now enter.
1528:The unliving are vanquished, but whatever dark force kept them trapped here exploded and buried the cave's entrance before you could explore what lay inside.
1529:Within the shrine you feel the grace of Nyia upon you.{}{}{}{}You also see a fountain of white ash falling from the cave's wall onto the ground.{}{}{}{}You have heard that touching this death-ash may bring fortune, but it may also bring calamity.
1530:Touch the ash before leaving.
1531:The arch leading to the shrine shimmers with a blue light and you know you may now enter.{}{}
1532:You come across a cave and your scouts report that it has tunnels deep inside, which may hold mysteries.
1533:[Hunter or perception] Check the area before going in.
1534:You go into the cave to see if it has good minerals within. But you are also startled by a nest of angry bats!
1535:You spot no recent humanoid activity, nor any large animal tracks.{}{}{}{}The cave does have good minerals within. You also see bat droppings, so you expect to find a nest. 
1536:Wait till nightfall, then try to sneak in while the bats are out feeding.
1537:The bats beat you badly and force you to flee.
1538:At nightfall, the bats set out for their feeding, and you sneak in to take what you can from the cave.{}{}{}{}Alas, the bats must have spotted you. They return and swarm you!
1539:You kill the bats and are free to explore.
1540:Search the cave.
1541:Search the cave, gather the loot, and leave.
1542:Deep within the cave, hidden away from sight, you discover the remains of a man clothed in heavy armour, black as night, a cape of some sort, and a hat with pointed bits, almost like a bat. You also find several odd mechanical gadgets, all rusty and broken now, but at least you can get some metal from the odd fellow.{}{}
1543:At nightfall, the bats set out for their feeding, and you sneak in to take what you can from the cave.
1544:[Hunter or Perception] Scout the cave first.
1545:The crushed figurine turns to flesh and blood and, as it breaks it screams in pain in a girl's voice. {}{}{}{}All signs of the bear's humanity disappear as the statue is destroyed and the animal becomes just that - a beast. {}{}{}{}It is, however, free to leave the cave and it does so, looking back at you with a final glimmer of human gratitude, or perhaps sadness.{}{}
1546:The bear screams out in pain in a girl's voice. {}{}{}{}All signs of its humanity disappear and the animal becomes just that - a beast. {}{}{}{}It is, however, free to leave this cave and it does so, looking back at you with a final glimmer of human gratitude, or perhaps sadness.{}{}
1547:You sneak in and gather some goods, but the bear wakes and attacks you viciously, forcing you to flee.{}{}
1548:You found an old abandoned mine. One of the shafts seems to lead deep inside and is still intact.
1549:Search the mine.
1550:The mine's resources look depleted, but not entirely gone. It looks like you can still gather some.
1551:Mine the resources.
1552:As you dig in, you see a light approach. It is what looks like a short, chubby old man with a grey beard, gold hair, and unnaturally large, white eyes.{}{}{}{}He stares at you. {}{}
1553:Say hello.
1554:Kill it!
1555:Try to figure out what this creature may be.
1556:'Yes, yes, hello indeed. But what in the underworlds are you doing in my tunnel?'
1557:Say that you seek to mine the resources. 
1558:Apologise and ask if you can mine here.
1559:You attack the creature, but before you reach him, he dissolves into golden ash. You hear his laughter ringing in your ears. {}{}{}{}There is a stash of goods you can grab that doesn't need mining.
1560:Keep mining.
1561:You attack the creature, but before you reach him, he dissolves into golden ash. You hear his laughter ringing in your ears. {}{}{}{}You hear the rolling of stones, and soon you see a pack of rockers coming your way!
1562:You think this may be a skarbnik, or treasurer demon. Very possessive, but also keen on flattery. If you outsmart him, he may reward you handsomely, but if you fail, he will likely take nasty revenge. 
1563:Speak praises for the demon.
1564:You feel the ground shake and you are forced to flee before the tunnel collapses.
1565:The creature giggles. You feel the ground shake and you are forced to flee before the tunnel collapses.
1566:'You give me half your food, I give you good minerals. And no, I will not say exactly how much of what. Deal?'
1567:Agree. [Lose 50% food]
1568:You defeat the rockers, but the whole mine begins to shake. You grab some stone on your way out, but you cannot stay and mine.
1569:You are beaten badly and forced to flee.
1570:With the treasurer's help, you gather some good minerals.
1571:'No.'{}{}{}{}You see gold nuggets fall out of the creature's beard as he shakes his fist at you.
1572:Insist that you will mine what you can and leave.
1573:Nod, but ask if maybe he will trade instead.
1574:'Ah, yes, I am fabulous, obviously, and yes, you are so unfortunate not to be me. Oh dear, oh dear, I do feel bad for you. Here, a present to cheer you up. Now go, go, I must polish my gold and shine my gems...'
1575:'Nasty, nasty creatures you are, coming here to trick me!'{}{}{}{}The ground beneath you shakes and you feel a curse upon you!
1576:'Fine, fine. You give me half your food, I give you good minerals. And no, I will not say exactly how much of what. Deal? Or else I'll have to teach you a lesson about arrogance.'
1577:Give up, leave.
1578:Ask for blessing of the body. [Trade good stone]
1579:Ask for blessing of the mind. [Trade good gemstones]
1580:Ask for blessing of the soul. [Trade good bones]
1581:You hand over the goods, and the hag pricks you with a crude curved dagger. {}{}{}{}She then spits into the blood, picks one of her warts, throws it in and eats the slimy concoction. She then throws up violently all over you, and although you are utterly sick, you do feel the effects of the promised blessing.
1582:You come across a cave. It looks like it was once inhabited, but the entrance is now overgrown and dark. 
1583:[Hunters or perception] Scout the cave first.
1584:You scout the cave and quickly realise that a large beast must reside here. There are huge claw marks on the walls, and you find several old, discarded scales, most likely from a dragon.
1585:[Magic or magic user]Strong magic emanates from within the cave. If a dragon lives here, it is likely protected by a spell while it sleeps. Keep a safe distance, but go in and have a closer look. 
1586:You go in and realise all too late that you stand before a dragon!{}{}{}{}It has just woken, but it looks ready to devour you.
1587:Drop some bags in an attempt to distract the drake, and then run.
1588:The dragon beats you badly and forces you to flee, abandoning some of your goods to save your lives.
1589:You slay the dragon and are free to loot the cave.
1590:'Oh, I see. Well, I say well done, dear chap. I am rather tired still, and the magic must be weak if you made it this far. {}{}{}{}Here, a small payment for services rendered. Now do be so kind as to do your work quietly. I would rather not have to devour such a useful critter as yourself.'
1591:Perform a ritual that will emit magic so the dragon thinks you did your job.
1592:Pray to your domain and ask for an intervention, else the beast may see through your lies.
1593:You come a bit closer and soon see a sleeping drake, coiled atop a pile of old rubble that likely hides treasures. {}{}{}{}The glow of potent magic strikes you hard now. If you go any farther, it will wake the beast.
1594:Try speaking to the dragon.
1595:Try to shield yourself from the spell, and then steal some of the treasures before the dragon wakes.
1596:The dragon lifts its head slowly as it wakes:{}{}{}{}'Why do you disturb my slumber?'{}{}
1597:Try to convince the dragon that you were merely checking the strength of the spell, and that if he pays you, you will ensure that he can sleep well for many more years.
1598:Say that you were simply interested in speaking to a dragon.
1599:Your shielding works, and you are able to carry off some loot before the beast wakes. 
1600:You sneak past the dragon and gather up some resources. You can't grab too much so as not to risk waking the beast, but you get a chest and some gems.
1601:You perform the ritual and the beast seems none the wiser. You are free to leave with your loot. {}{}
1602:You perform a ritual and it seems to work at first, but then the beast fidgets and grumbles at you:{}{}{}{}'I say! I am an elder beast weaved from magic itself. Using common trickery, on me!'{}{}{}{}It rises, and you'd better run fast before it fully wakes.{}{}
1603:Try to run.
1604:You perform the prayer and the dragon seems satisfied. In fact, you feel some of his magic gifted to you.
1605:'How refreshing to meet business-minded folk. Now, please depart, as I am a kindly old fella, but only to a point.'{}{}{}{}The dragon takes his prize and shows his teeth to encourage your swift retreat.{}{}
1606:The dragon speaks beautifully; his voice resounds with ancient wisdom and charisma, and his natural aura is entrancing.{}{}{}{}So much so that you do not notice quickly enough what he is doing. He grabs the beautiful object of his attention and flies away!{}{}
1607:The dragon speaks beautifully; his voice resounds with ancient wisdom and charisma, and his natural aura is entrancing.{}{}{}{}When you depart, you feel wiser. {}{}
1608:'Ooh, you are pretty. I suppose I can spare some of my time for such a face. Let me tell you a tale of heroic deeds, gallant adventures, and of course budding romance.'{}{}
1609:Listen.
1610:'Well, I am getting a tad peckish. If you feed me, I will grant you treasures.{}{}{}{}I will accept a few pets, a tasty young one, or a fresh-looking virgin -- or, well, someone who can pass as one. I have learned long ago to let go of that expectation. Or I suppose I will take meat, but I won't give you as good a reward for it.'{}{}
1611:Feed three pets to him.
1612:Give him one child.
1613:Sacrifice one pretty person.
1614:Give him meat.
1615:You meddle with the spell and it backfires. Worse yet, the dragon stirs and turns your way!
1616:You sneak in and start gathering some goods, but a powerful spell pushes you out and you hear the angry beast waking!
1617:'Well, that is mighty civilised of you. However, may I point out the fallacy of such a wish? Not to brag, but I am rather skilled at devouring creatures such as yourself, and truth be told, I sometimes cannot help but do it...'
1618:[Beautiful]Implore the drake to spare some time for you, for he is such a handsome beast and surely has many stories to tell.
1619:Ask the dragon if he would be willing to trade with you for some of the goods he surely has.
1620:Say that you are well aware of his greatness and, as such, you know him to be an honourable creature. Tell him that his infinite wisdom and beauty are too much to resist for such simple folk as you.
1621:You escape and feel strengthened by it. Luckily for you, the dragon seems uninterested in chasing you beyond his cave.
1622:'Well, I say, you do know what is good for you, that's for sure. {}{}{}{}I suppose I can spare a little time telling you my tales. Why not? Let me tell you a tale of heroic deeds, gallant adventures, and of course budding romance.'
1623:The dragon speaks beautifully; his voice resounds with ancient wisdom and charisma, and his natural aura is entrancing.{}{}{}{}And by the time he finishes, you realise you were robbed as you see the drake flying away with half your goods!{}{}
1624:You spot a dragon - the one who stole from you!
1625:Face the dragon in a battle of spirits!
1626:Do nothing for now and leave.
1627:The dragon lies slain and you reclaim what is yours.
1628:The drake defeats you and flies away.
1629:You find an old cave that goes deep into the ground. It seems abandoned at first, but the deeper you go, the more you feel a warmth touching your skin, and soon you see the glow of light.
1630:[Hunter or perception]Try to scout ahead. 
1631:Go in. 
1632:You examine the floor, the walls, and the tracks, and you conclude that people came this way, but fewer tracks lead back out.{}{}{}{}You scouted a room ahead, but cannot see inside it without entering.{}{}
1633:The cave is vast within this chamber, as if grown unnaturally. You see a waterfall at the far end of a stream running through the cave. Gold, gems, and all sorts of riches are scattered around in mounds. {}{}{}{}A voice speaks:{}{}{}{}'Welcome, come hither, rest and be done with thy worries.'{}{}
1634:Talk to this voice and ask who they are.
1635:[Magic user]Keep your wits at the ready, as you feel the tingling of mystical forces here. Ask the voice who they are.
1636:'Me? I am called many things. Mammon is one that is old, so let us address me so. {}{}{}{}Now, my gallant guest. Does thy heart desire wealth? For as you can see, 'tis in abundance in my humble abode and thine for the taking if thee so wishes.'{}{}
1637:He wants to give you riches? Why, what is the catch?
1638:[Wisdom or zerca]Mammon? You have not heard of such a demon. Who is he?
1639:'Me? I am called many things. Mammon is one that is old, so let us address me so. {}{}{}{}Now, my gallant guest. Does thy heart desire wealth? For as you can see, 'tis in abundance in my humble abode and thine for the taking if thee so wishes.'{}{}{}{} [ID]876593413[TXT]'A demon I will be called in another world, a god was I hailed in yet another time. It matters not. Drakes call me villain for I trample on their path, treasurer demons cower before me as I master what they can only mimic. Now, does thee desire wealth? Will it not soothe your troubles, forge weapons of protection, and lead you to better serve your masters?'
1640:'A demon I will be called in another world, a god was I hailed in yet another time. It matters not. Drakes call me villain for I trample on their path, treasurers cower before me as I master what they can only mimic. Now, does thy desire wealth? Will it not soothe your troubles, forge weapons of protection and lead you to better serve your masters?'
1641:'I will give thee wealth if thee giveth me a life. One of you remain here and become part of my treasury. The others walk away with riches. {}{}{}{}Will it not soothe your troubles, forge weapons for protection, and lead you to better serve your masters?'
1642:How much wealth? 
1643:Refuse it all. Leave.
1644:Agree. 
1645:[Magic user]Focus on this voice.
1646:Try to just take the gold and leave.
1647:'Enough for a better start, but not so much as to render your heroic adventures meaningless. Champion. {}{}{}{}Thy wealth will be in the hands of fate if thee walk this path with me. {}{}{}{}Or, I have another proposal, one that will promise some wealth, though not as much.'{}{}
1648:What proposal?
1649:Agree to trade one person.
1650:'How delightful it is for even the chosen of the gods to follow my path instead. Here, your virtue lost, your coffers grown, my heart filled with joy. Farewell.'{}{}{}{}Your companion is drawn towards the voice and as soon as they touch the flowing stream, they collapse into a pile of gold. A small sachet is left for you to take, and then the whole cave becomes just an old abandoned chamber.
1651:'You may search this cave for that which is my most precious treasure. If thy fate is strong, it shall be rewarded, yes? If it is not, thy life will be forfeit.'{}{}{}{}He points to a skeleton in full armour.{}{}
1652:Who was he, then?
1653:Agree to search for this greatest treasure.
1654:'A knight who once left my cave proving his great virtue, but here, he never did leave. So what path will thy gods guide you on?'
1655:Whatever this being is, they are not here physically. Instead, they have attached themselves with their spirit. {}{}{}{}You can try to assault this spirit and perhaps sever the connection. 
1656:No, go back to talking to it.
1657:You sever the connection and the cave is transformed into an old, mouldy place. All the gold and wealth is gone too, but you see several remains, including one of a warrior clad in full armour.
1658:Take what you can and leave.
1659:Whatever creature this was, it struck back and drained your spirit.{}{}{}{}When you regain your composure, the cave has been transformed into an old, mouldy place with no trace of the gold or anything else.{}{}
1660:'A virtuous hero, my, my. Thee followeth the path of some brave knights to come. Very well. Begone.'{}{}{}{}A bright light blinds you. When you regain your composure, the cave has been transformed into an old, mouldy place with no trace of the gold or anything else. But you feel your souls cleansed.{}{}
1661:As soon as you try to grab a big bag of treasure, you feel a sharp pain sting your very soul. The voice booms:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes, the call of wealth, forever so loud and beautiful. Come, come, take more!'{}{}
1662:Try to take it and run out.
1663:Leave the treasure and run out of this cave.
1664:One of you turns into a pile of gold before your eyes!{}{}{}{}You hear laughter all around you. Your body begins to feel odd.
1665:You search through the treasures, but they all seem the same -- rich, opulent, and extravagant. {}{}{}{}Then you spot a mirror, and while it is ornate, you notice that it is placed slightly apart from all the clutter, and the ground beneath it seems worn, as if it is a spot well used.{}{}
1666:Point to the mirror as the most treasured of possessions.
1667:You search through the treasures, but they all seem the same - rich, opulent, and extravagant. Then you spot a book placed on a pedestal. You point to it and the voice answers:{}{}{}{}'Alas, no. I treasure all my wealth equally. Thee have not discovered the one that is not so. Come now, stay with me for eternity as penance.'{}{}
1668:Try to run away!
1669:'Observant, yes. You shall be rewarded for your good eye. Fare thee well.'
1670:Ask him why it is so precious.
1671:'I love myself most, yes? Or do I gaze upon the once-mortal face and ponder my own frailty? Or perhaps I cherish my beauty above all. Ha ha. Be well, young god spawn.'{}{}{}{}The cave turns into an ordinary chamber.{}{}
1672:You accidentally step on a bee's nest, and as you try to flee, you see a cave you could run into. 
1673:Enter the cave.
1674:Brave the bees.
1675:You take cover in the cave, but you soon realise that you are not alone. There is a wounded bear trapped by some rocks. It looks at you pleadingly.
1676:[Forest demon]This is no bear - this is a borowy, one of the leshy guardians of the forests. Try to rescue him.
1677:[Animal kinship]Examine this bear.
1678:Ignore the bear and see if there is anything worth gathering in the cave.
1679:You try to push through and outrun the bees, but you get stung a bit before you make it.
1680:The cave doesn't hold much - just some moss, old bones, and shrooms.
1681:Leave once the bees are gone.
1682:This is no bear - this is a borowy, one of the leshy guardians of the forests that is known to sometimes take the form of a bear.
1683:Try to rescue him.
1684:The bear is protected by pineconettes, but you kill them without trouble. {}{}{}{}When you walk through the forest later, you feel a chill down your spine.{}{}
1685:You pull the rocks away from the bear. It lifts its head and speaks: {}{}{}{}'I thank you. This cave is soon to collapse, so I feared I would die in here before my flock could come rescue me. Be well, friend, and my forest be home to you.'{}{}{}{}He slowly hobbles away.{}{}
1686:Ask him what he is - clearly not just a bear.
1687:This cave is very unstable. You try to move the rocks, but the whole thing collapses and you barely get out. 
1688:A young bear appears not long after, and it obediently follows you. Must be a reward from the rescued creature.
1689:Take the bear and leave.
1690:This is no ordinary bear, but some kind of demon - though whether good or bad, you do not know.
1691:He stops and turns to you to answer:{}{}{}{}'Just a bear? We are the best of creatures. Still, I am many things, a bear being but one. Borowy some call me. In these lands, you likely know us as leshy, albeit technically they are cousins of ours. {}{}{}{}Now I must go, as my forest awaits.' {}{}
1692:Wish him well and leave.
1693:The burial ground is eerie and still. You realise there are no animals, and even the wind goes still here. {}{}{}{}One of the graves looks particularly odd.
1694:[Goblin]This is goblin ground; a goblin should investigate.
1695:[Ghost]Ghosts can sense each other. There's a spirit here somewhere.
1696:Your godly connection to the domain of magic shivers. Threads of the greyworld from whence spirits come linger here. Use a ritual to call upon the lost souls.
1697:Investigate the grave.
1698:Threads of the greyworld from whence spirits come linger here. Use a ritual to call upon the lost souls.
1699:You walk over and sense there is a spirit trapped here. It sees you and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Help, friend.'
1700:[Goblin shaman]Ask if he is a spirit of the greyworld, not just a lost soul.
1701:You should have listened to the shamans more. Ask if he is a ghost or something else.
1702:You focus and immediately know there is a ghostly presence. It speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'Help me, ethereal friend. Though we are not the same, surely you can hear my plea?'
1703:Tell him that he seems different from you, as if he were never a living being in the first place.
1704:A spirit emerges and speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'Help me...'
1705:Ask why they need help.
1706:Shrug and ask why you should care.
1707:Attack the ghost!
1708:The air is stale and cold, and you realise that everything around you slowly drains of colour, turning grey. {}{}{}{}You see flickers of a ghostly figure, its arms outstretched, its mouth open in a silent scream.
1709:The spirit shifted from existence, so your weapons proved useless. {}{}{}{}You feel some life drained from you, but as you stumble outside the boundaries of the grave site to escape, you realise the angry soul cannot pursue.
1710:'Yes, spirit walker, that I am. I was easing the passing for one of your kind, but a ray of light washed over this ground and froze all time and space. I am trapped here for eternity!'
1711:Ask what traps him here.
1712:Ask about the greyworld. Tell the ghost your shaman training was short-lived when you were called to serve the cosmic pantheon.
1713:'I am no ghost - that is, not a soul of the once living, but a spirit from the greyworld. I was easing the passing for one of your kind, but a ray of light washed over this ground and froze all time and space. I am trapped here for eternity!'
1714:Thank them for the answer and return to the matter at hand.
1715:Ask about the greyworld.
1716:'I have no time for lessons. Mortals confuse the greyworld with their afterlife. Spirit walkers call it the in-between, and others say we reflect your reality, an imprint of your emotions and experiences.' {}{}{}{}
1717:So which is the right answer?
1718:'I am not an old spirit. I know not the answer. The greyworld is where I live. Your souls travel through our world sometimes, yes, and some even stay if we let them. Others go further. That is all I know.'
1719:Thank them for explaining.
1720:'As I said before, I am trapped by the stifling power of the lightbringers - their scorching souls be damned. It is as if time itself yielded to their stagnation.{}{}{}{}The only thing I can think of is a burst of darkness to free me. And I do sense some unliving souls nearby. Their unnatural binding to life will suffice, but you must kill them for me first. Please.'
1721:Offer to capture the spirit's essence and carry it to a nearby place of power where you can attempt to truly free them. But you know this may destroy the spirit if it goes wrong.
1722:[Goblin shaman]This binding is made of darkness. You sense it well. Agree to perform a ritual, but warn the spirit that turmoil is chaos, and the effects may vary.
1723:You do sense the trembling of turmoil in the air. Agree to perform a ritual, but warn the spirit that turmoil is chaos, and the effects may vary.
1724:Fight the unliving.
1725:No, it is too risky. Leave.
1726:'I am no ghost -- that is, not a soul of the once living, but a spirit from the greyworld. I was easing the passing for one of your kind, but a ray of light washed over this ground and froze all time and space. I am trapped here for eternity!'
1727:Ask what can be done.
1728:'I... don't know, I suppose. I can't even say that I would care if the situation were reversed.{}{}{}{}Still, I beg your help. If you succeed, I will reward you, I promise!'
1729:Tell them to be more specific: what reward? And why should you trust that you will get it?
1730:Nod and ask what help is needed here.
1731:'Again, I have no answer. My reward will depend on how I fare from this ordeal. My powers may be diminished, but at the very least, I will bestow a blessing upon you.'
1732:'Risk be damned, my friends. Let's go to this place of power of yours!'
1733:Capture the spirit's essence and carry it with you.
1734:'Risk be damned, my friends. Please do it.'
1735:Perform the ritual and call upon turmoil. 
1736:Decline -- it is too risky.
1737:The essence of turmoil seeps through you and touches the spirit, breaking it free of the now-visible strand of stifling light. But it does not stop there. It twists the ghostly figure, turning it into an animal.{}{}{}{}The creature stares at you in dismay.
1738:Say that you did warn them of side effects. Offer to let the animal come with you. 
1739:The essence of turmoil seeps through you and touches the spirit, breaking it free of the now-visible strand of stifling light. {}{}{}{}'Thank you, spirit walker. Your kind is forever our kin. May we meet again in the greypaths.'
1740:The spirit adds that you may call upon it in need from now on. Nod and take your leave.
1741:Nod, dig the goods out, and take your leave.
1742:The domains of turmoil and magic, or the pure force of those who know mystical secrets, can call upon the power of darkness and counteract the light that is keeping the spirit still. {}{}{}{}The spirit nods in agreement.
1743:Begin the ritual.
1744:The essence of darkness seeps through you and touches the spirit, breaking it free of the now-visible strand of stifling light. {}{}{}{}'You did it! Thank you, thank you so much. Here, dig in this spot, for I know there is treasure to be found.'
1745:You defeat the unliving and the spirit drains some force from their vanquished corpses. It seems to regain a more physical or at least stronger form:{}{}{}{}'You did it! Thank you, thank you so much. You can call upon my aid from now on.'
1746:Nod and take your leave.
1747:You defeat the light-wraiths and the dwarven spirit seems to regain a more physical or at least stronger form:{}{}{}{}'You did it! Thank you, thank you so much. Here, dig in this spot, for I know there is treasure to be found.'
1748:You failed. The spirit dissolves and there's nothing more you can do.
1749:You discover a goblin cemetery.
1750:Have a closer look.
1751:As you enter the burial grounds, you feel the earth shift and notice bony hands coming out of the ground!
1752:Sense the weaves of magic in this area.
1753:[Nature] These unliving defy the lore of nature. Find a way to destroy them.
1754:[Unliving] Speak to your kin. Perhaps they too are awakened and not merely puppets of dark magic.
1755:The bones are laid to their final rest. 
1756:You sense these skeletal forms are controlled by a dark spell, but one that is not fresh. It may be possible to break it, but only if you have strong magic on your side. 
1757:Try to release the skeletons from their dark magic bondage.
1758:It may go against the laws of nature's domain, but bind the skeletons to your own service!
1759:This unliving abomination mocks the laws of nature. You should try to relieve their eternal suffering.
1760:Use a ritual to break the dark magic binding these poor bodies into servitude.
1761:The domains of nature and harmony stand against enslaving dead flesh to one's will. {}{}{}{}Your ritual dissolves, and the bones collapse at peace. You feel a sickness upon you.{}{}
1762:The ritual works, and you gain the servitude of an unliving fiend.{}{}
1763:The binding ritual seems to work, but then a burst of uncontrolled energy destroys the unliving.{}{}{}{}However, a wraith is born out of the force and it now follows you.
1764:The rituals do not work, and you barely escape from the unliving.{}{}
1765:'You, you friend. Friend go, we not tear flesh.'{}{}{}{}The unliving turn and walk away, but one of them leaves his weapons for you, and you see a glimmer of awakening in his eyes.
1766:Good, leave.
1767:'You, you friend. Friend go, we not tear flesh.'{}{} {}{}The skeletons move away, but one stays behind: 'You, you serve no more. Me, me serve you.'{}{}{}{}This may not be the awakening you hoped for, but it's a first step. The skeleton now serves you.
1768:The skeletons continue coming at you mindlessly and some arrows fly your way. {}{}
1769:Just leave this place.
1770:Attack them!
1771:The skeletons beat you badly and you barely escape.
1772:The cemetery is quiet and empty. You see an unburied body on the ground clutching a stash of goods.
1773:Grab the stash.
1774:Take the stash and bury the corpse.
1775:As you grab the stash, the decaying hand that held it grabs you and digs in deep before falling lifeless again. You feel a foul force has touched you.
1776:You try to bury the corpse, but clearly you have offended its spirit somehow. You feel its anger reaching from the beyond and cursing you!
1777:You see a strange trinket at one of the burial sites.
1778:[Goblin]Try to work out the right combination for this trinket.
1779:The trinket seems to hold a puzzle. Take a closer look.
1780:[Orc]You don't have a clue what this is but try fiddling with it.
1781:You don't have a clue what this is but try fiddling with it.
1782:Whatever this is, try to pry it open.
1783:Just leave it be.
1784:The qizicons [R3]are an old goblin tradition dating back to the old country -- a fabled place of your kind's origin. A trinket master, or shaman as you now call them, will leave such an object as a sign of their legacy. This one doesn't look too complicated, but it may be booby-trapped.
1785:Try to open it.
1786:No, it is too dangerous. Leave. 
1787:The thing explodes when you hit it! You suffer some burns, but you may yet recover some goods.
1788:Gather what is intact inside and leave.
1789:You were so close, but you turn the wrong lever and the whole thing explodes in your hands!
1790:You read of old goblin customs where shamans would leave objects behind to trick any grave looters. Or was it to pass on some of their legacy? In either case, whatever the object may hold, it is likely rigged against tampering.
1791:Open it forcefully.
1792:You fail and a message in smoke puffs out:{}{}{}{}'Ha! Stupid orc.'{}{}{}{}The contraption then explodes.
1793:The deathly silence cannot be good. Prepare a warding ritual and investigate.
1794:You walk over and sense there is a goblin spirit roaming this burial site. Strangely, it feels trapped -- goblins typically change into spirit form and become part of the greyworld, and as such, they do not go to the human underworlds.
1795:Draw basic spirit runes to summon the spirit and speak to it. Ask why its soul still lingers here.
1796:Perform a cleansing ritual to be rid of the dark magic.
1797:You sense there is a goblin soul stuck here, which is odd as goblins tend to change into spirit forms and live in the greyworld. {}{}{}{}Worse yet, you begin to feel a dark necromantic spell holding any soul that comes here. Luckily, you are awakened and strengthened by your god, but it will still be hard to leave.
1798:Use magic to perform a cleansing ritual and free all souls that are trapped here.
1799:Convince the souls trapped here to join you and give you power to push through and escape.
1800:Leave while you can.
1801:Attack the spirits. Their destruction may allow you to break this curse.
1802:You sense the weaves of necromantic magic in this place. They are likely holding any souls trapped and maybe even in servitude.{}{}
1803:Do a cleansing ritual.
1804:'You, shaman? Tell me why this is happening!'{}{}{}{}The spirit wails in pain.{}{}{}{}You feel this whole burial ground is tainted with necromantic magic that is blocking them from reaching the greyworld or even fully turning into spirit forms.{}{}
1805:The dark magic is very strong. Offer to push one soul through the veil.
1806: Your magic is not strong enough to risk it. Fight the ghosts to at least weaken their presence here.
1807:The cleansing lifts a heavy veil of dark energy from this burial site, and you feel the goblin souls slowly passing into the greyworld as they should.{}{}{}{}You feel your faith rising, and one of the changed spirits chooses to become your ally.
1808:The cleansing lifts a heavy veil of dark energy from this burial site, and you feel the goblin souls slowly passing into the greyworld as they should.{}{}{}{}You feel your faith rising. 
1809:You force yourself through the necromantic barrier and push the soul into the greyworld. You glimpse the soul changing into a spirit as it should, and you feel its blessing upon you.
1810:You convince the other souls to merge with you, and together you push through the dark spell.{}{}{}{}One of the souls, now changed into its rightful spirit form, decides to become your ally.
1811:You convince the other souls to merge with you and together you push through the dark spell.{}{}
1812:You defeat the lost souls, and one of them attaches itself to you in servitude. {}{}
1813:This place seems eerie and unpleasant. Ghosts appear before you, wailing and stretching their arms to get to you. You must try to resist their pull or they may possess your very soul.
1814:Try to resist with your spirit.
1815:Resist with the power of your mind.
1816:Your spirit is strong, and the ghostly assailants cannot break it. You feel strengthened by this ordeal.
1817:You manage to escape the ghosts, but your soul feels tainted.
1818:Your mind is strong and cannot be broken, especially when guided by your divine domain.
1819:Your mind is strong and cannot be broken. The ghosts give up.
1820:Defeated, you are forced to flee this place.
1821:You discover a dwarven cemetery.
1822:You enter the old cave and see statues of dwarves, but among them stand several guards.
1823:[Dwarf]Welcome your kinsmen.
1824:[Light]Offer a welcome in the name of light.
1825:[Harmony]Greet the dwarven guards with words of peace.
1826:Convince the guards to let you in.
1827:'Stone heart and iron soul brethren, what seek you here?'
1828:Say that you are here to pay your respects to the fallen.
1829:Tell them you are seeking resources to strengthen your hearth.
1830:'You may enter and seek the praise of the stone and iron. If worthy, you will be rewarded.'{}{}{}{}They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1831:Enter the ring.
1832:Ask to trade with your brothers.
1833:'Were you an outsider, our hammers would speak to such a request. But you are stone and iron brethren, so you may take up a challenge and be judged by the elders. If they deem it so, you will gain your rewards.'{}{}{}{}They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1834:'You are no stone and iron brethren, but the light of the forge lights your path. You may enter. What do you seek here?'
1835:Admit you are searching for resources.
1836:'You are no stone and iron brethren, but the path of harmony guides you, and we will not stand in its peaceful way with war. You may enter. What do you seek here?'
1837:'You are no stone or iron brethren, and we feel no affinity to your plea, yet you spoke well. You may enter. What is it that you seek?'
1838:'You are no stone or iron brethren, and we feel no affinity to your plea. Leave this place or die!'
1839:'This is no place for idle wandering and no place for strangers. But times are anew, so perhaps the spirits of old may honour you. You may enter, but you will face trial, and if you fail, the punishment will be swift.'{}{}{}{}They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1840:Offer to trade instead.
1841:'These are new days and our purpose is old. Your words ring true, and it was brave to speak them to us. We will allow you to enter and face a trial as if you were one of ours. More we cannot do. Beware, for if you fail, well...'{}{}{}{}They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1842:'Ha, ha! What? It was no jest you spoke? Go away now, before you taste our stone and iron!'
1843:Fine, leave.
1844:You were not deemed worthy and are weakened. {}{}{}{}'Ah, worry not, for few pass the trials. Stone and iron be with you on your way.'
1845:They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1846:You defeat the guardians. Within the underground structure, you find a stone ring -- empty, quiet.{}{}{}{}
1847:Go in and gather some of the stone.
1848:Better just leave now.
1849:'Always good to trade with honest kin. Now will you face the stone and iron inside?'{}{}{}{}They show you a stone ring. You know you must enter and be judged by the stone and iron spirit.
1850:The ancient spirit within the earth judges you worthy of its abundance. You gain a blessing and a small gift.
1851:Give thanks and leave.
1852:You were not deemed worthy and are weakened. {}{}{}{}'Bah. It was always a long shot for a stranger to pass. Put some herbs on it -- may help ya. Now leave.'
1853:'Good tradin' with ya. Now be off.'{}{}
1854:You enter an old underground chamber, made accessible when the earth moved, and you see what must have been a dwarf cemetery. It now stands in ruins. Worse yet, whatever remains is being vigorously eaten by a pack of small stone creatures, likely rockers!{}{}
1855:[Dwarf]Defilers of sacred grounds. Attack!
1856:[Dwarf]Command the stone creatures to obey.
1857:Try talking to the creatures.
1858:[Domain]Allow your domain to guide you and figure out why the creatures are so agitated.
1859:Better not mess with dwarven graves or rockers. Leave.
1860:You destroy the rockers and feel the spirits of the elders looking down on you in thanks. Even though these were creatures of stone, they were clearly mad to attack a sacred ground.{}{}{}{}One of the statues presents you with a weapon in reward!
1861:You destroy the rockers and feel the spirits of the elders looking down on you in thanks. Even though these were creatures of stone, they were clearly mad to attack a sacred ground.{}{}
1862:There are too many of them -- oh, the shame! Your dwarven pride suffers, but they were creatures of stone, so maybe it was meant to be.
1863:The rockers hear you and look terrified. One of them rolls over to you and cries:{}{}'You, you small stone people, you help? Me want papa and mamma back. We eat and eat, but can't eat down...'{}{}{}{}The rocker cries pebbles, and the others join in.
1864:Look around and try to help them.
1865:Just chase them away!
1866:The rockers are so scared of you that they roll out without any resistance. There's a lot of stone here that you can salvage without disrespecting the graves.
1867:Gather up the stones, pay your respects to the elders, and leave.
1868:You see large metal gates on the ground. This is where the little ones think their parents are. Since they cannot chew through metal yet, they tried eating all around. {}{}{}{}The gates are actually not that hard to open, but these rockers are clearly too young to think much.
1869:Open the gates for them. 
1870:You move one of the gate doors and see only ground and rock, but the little ones get excited. They lunge into the rocks and within minutes disappear into the depths. Perhaps with years of digging, one could follow them, but then again, they did say troll parents await them.{}{}{}{}There is plenty of stone for you to gather without disrespecting the elders, so perhaps it is best to leave it be.
1871:You try to lift one of the gate doors, and the rockers spill under it as soon as you move it off the ground. Alas, the gate is too heavy and the walls too unstable. The whole thing collapses, crushing the little creatures and wounding you in the process.{}{}
1872:The rockers seem to be trying to eat their way underneath fallen metal gates. The gates would be easy for you to move or open and the creatures seem preoccupied, but there could be some risk. You could also scavenge stone away from the rockers without disturbing the burial ground any further.
1873:Just gather some stone and leave.
1874:You have no idea why the rockers are in such a frenzy. But there's a lot of potential loot to gather here.
1875:Better just leave. 
1876:The rockers get even more agitated and violent, but do not respond to you. 
1877:Well, better leave this place, even though the ancestors may get angry.
1878:Better just leave.
1879:You are badly beaten and forced to flee.{}{}
1880:Despite its first appearance, this seems to be an old dwarven burial ground - an unusual find. You spot a rugged group of grave robbers who got here before you!
1881:[Dwarf]Attack the defilers of sacred ground!
1882:Try talking to them. Maybe you can share the spoils.
1883:Wait till they leave.
1884:The grave robbers destroy much of the burial ground, then suddenly grab their stuff and skulk away in haste.
1885:[Zerca or dwarf]Perform the correct burial rites to appease the disturbed spirits here.
1886:Try to repair the burial ground to honour the dead.
1887:See if they left anything to loot.
1888:You perform the appropriate rituals and make the ground sacred again. You feel the spirits that linger are still angry, but not at you.
1889:Gather some stone that was left loose, and leave.
1890:You try to repair the burial site, but you feel the spirits that linger are angry, and they lash out at you!
1891:Try performing a ritual to calm the spirits.
1892:The angered ghosts leave you depleted, but they do not follow you as you flee.
1893:You realise the grave robbers left because angry ghosts rose up, and now they are ready to attack!
1894:You lost, and the grave robbers rob you as well!{}{}{}{}Getting your stuff back while butt naked won't be easy.{}{}
1895:'What? You mean instead of stickin' ya, lettin' ya take stuff?'
1896:[Harmony]As harmony is your path, say that you seek peace, not violence.
1897:Confirm.
1898:[Dwarf]Shake your fist at them and say that no, you mean you will not kill them if they leave now!
1899:You gather the loot, but you soon realise that whatever spirits these grave robbers unsettled, they are equally unimpressed with you. {}{}
1900:You destroy the grave robbers and put the graves back as they should be. {}{}{}{}You feel the spirits of metal and stone favour you.
1901:Bow to the spirits in thanks.
1902:With the grave robbers gone, you put the graves back as they should be. {}{}{}{}You feel the spirits of metal and stone favour you.
1903:'You talk and talk, but we ain't no talkers, so just leave us be or get your teeth smashed!'
1904:You are badly beaten and forced to flee.
1905:'I guess there's lots of lootin' to do here. We go that way, you go there.'
1906:Agree and loot your area.
1907:'All right, all right, mister dwarf, we'll go. Sorry...'
1908:Allow them to leave. Remake the burial ground. 
1909:This foreboding grave site must have been exposed when the earth moved. Stone and metal statues of fallen dwarves stand tall and proud, despite any damage.{}{}{}{}And yet, apart from the expected damage, you see some of the graves were clearly robbed! The air here is cold and threatening.
1910:[Dwarf]This dishonour requires blood! Rush in and see who is responsible.
1911:You sense the weaves of magic here -- perhaps a spirit presence. Perform a ritual to call upon this presence.
1912:[Goblin shaman]There is a spirit presence here -- a strange one, but unmistakable. Try speaking to it.
1913:You walk over and sense that something is watching you. From one of the statues a voice speaks up: 'Who goes there? Friend or foe? Speak ya fast!'
1914:[Runemaster]A stone spirit! Say that you are kindred souls.
1915:Say you are a friend.
1916:Ask how they are different from you.
1917:Ask how you can help.
1918:Ask what help they need.
1919:Why should you care?
1920:[Mysticism] You sense the weaves of magic here -- perhaps a spirit presence. Perform a ritual to call upon this presence.
1921:'A stone and iron son, good!' {}{}{}{}The stone statue becomes animated and turns to you.{}{}{}{}'A runesmith, no less! Can you forge me a new deathstone, so that I may be free? No, not enough time, I suppose.'
1922:Ask who is holding the spirit here.
1923:Ask about deathstones.
1924:Say you have never met a stone spirit before, only heard about them.
1925:'A stone and iron son, good! You can help. You can kill those honourless buggers that hold me here!'
1926:Ask what he is.
1927:'Aye, aye, deathstone. Only the runesmiths of old know them well. But in short, it is the rune stone that binds me in my form, makes me a guardian. It should be lodged where my heart was, but as you see, it is gone, so my power fades.'
1928:'I am weak, and you are no kin of mine... please help...'
1929:So what can be done?
1930:'Filthy grave robbers came and defiled our forefathers. Lucky bastards took the deathstone before I was able to fully awaken. Now they are trapped in a tomb, but they hold my deathstone. We're at an impasse.'
1931:[Orc witch]Offer to perform a ritual instead. It will give the spirit enough power to sort this out themselves.
1932:Offer to perform a ritual instead. It will give the spirit enough power to sort this out themselves.
1933:Agree to go in and fight the grave robbers.
1934:Say that you are sorry, but you will not risk it. Leave.
1935:'My deathstone, my heart... stolen... gone... '
1936:Deathstone?
1937:The spirit remains silent, its presence flickering in and out of focus. You feel a buildup of dark energies.
1938:'Stone spirit is one name I am given, and a good one, I say. From what I gather, and knowin' was not my strength, I was once a fallen warrior, my soul so strong it wished to remain and serve, so great smiths forged me a stone heart -- the deathstone -- and thus made me guardian of this burial ground. {}{}
1939:'Aye! Risk is good. It is bad that I will leave my place of duty, but if we succeed, I will return strong again!'
1940:Capture the willing essence.
1941:'Bah, filthy orc magic to meddle with my soul. Eh!'
1942:Grunt something offensive about their stone brain in return, but perform the ritual.
1943:'Who are you calling filth, you stone brain can of rubble?' Attack the ghost instead.
1944:You jump to attack the dwarven ghost, but realise you are facing the grave robbers he needed someone to dispose of. The damned rockbrain has tricked you.
1945:Ask what sort of spirit presence they are.
1946:You defeat the spirits that assailed you. The ground shakes and the cemetery, with its statues and underground chambers, collapses. You hear screams of dying people from one such chamber... but at least there is extra loot to gather.
1947:The grave robbers lie dead, and you find a stone covered in runes -- the deathstone. The guardian spirit calls out to you:{}{}{}{}'Have you got it? Put it in my chest, quickly.'
1948:Put the deathstone into the dwarven statue's chest.
1949:Destroy the deathstone.
1950:'Thank you,' the spirit whispers as the stone absorbs its heart and the statue grows quiet. {}{}{}{}The ground shakes, and from under a stone comes a gift for you.
1951:The earth shakes beneath your feet as the stone crumbles. You see the spirit released, but it is angered. {}{}{}{}The cemetery falls to ruin - nothing but rubble left.
1952:You are defeated and forced to flee. As you run, you see the guardian statue collapse into rubble and hear the spirit cry out in despair.
1953:The ritual worked. You called upon your divine link and weaved the magic around you to strengthen the stone spirit.{}{}{}{}You see the statue move faster than any stone should. It rushes into the nearby catacombs, and you hear the cries of dying grave robbers.{}{}
1954:Wait.
1955:The statue returns to its place, and you see its chest now has a runestone inside. {}{}{}{}'Thank you. I will sleep now. Dare not rob this place, but instead take whatever the scum left, and this gift as my thanks.'
1956:Nod, gather the loot, and leave.
1957:The ritual failed and instead caused the spirit harm. The ground shakes, the catacombs collapse, and screams of dying grave robbers reach you as you run. You see the guardian statue collapse into rubble and hear the spirit cry out in despair.
1958:What you thought was a cemetery is actually much more. You enter the ancient ruins of a dwarven city, now unearthed and exposed to the surface. Fallen statues, crumbled and forlorn yet still imposing, gaze upon you as you wander the silent streets.{}{}
1959:[Dwarf]You know the layout well. Explore the ruins.
1960:Search the ruins for loot or anything of interest.
1961:You soon realise this is only a small part of a greater city clearly pushed out by the Shattering. You also see that it has been looted many times already. {}{}{}{}Still, you think this was the craftsman district, so you know where to look for the great forge, the artisan workshop, and the runemaster's study.
1962:Go to the forge.
1963:Go to the workshop.
1964:Go to the study.
1965:You find the great forge mostly in ruins, but you know that the real forge would have been hidden away deep within, so you can try to search for the entrance. 
1966:[Smith]You know exactly where to find it. Go in.
1967:Look for the entrance.
1968:Among the rubble and dust of the fallen main hall, behind the remains of a giant anvil, you find the passage leading deeper into the city, where you discover the master smith's forge.{}{}{}{}The place is abandoned, cleared out not by looters but likely by the owner, although you spot several tools and resources you can still salvage.{}{}{}{}As you start collecting the loot, you hear a faint, dull thud that becomes more and more regular.
1969:You are now sure you hear the sounds of a working forge, the smelting of metal, and the drumming of the hammer. You even smell the hot coals.{}{}{}{}You blink, and suddenly you find yourself in that forge! A blacksmith here works on something with his back to you.
1970:Politely ask the smith what this place is and how you got here.
1971:'Ah, it is a long story, laddie.'{}{}{}{}As the smith turns to you, you see a dwarven corpse that has been partially eaten by bugs, its eye sockets empty and dark, jaw hanging by a thread, rotten flesh falling off.
1972:Exclaim your outrage at the fate of your brother.
1973:Say that he has clearly been here a while, perhaps taking his duties a tad too seriously.
1974:Ignore his looks and ask how you got here when just a moment before you were standing in old ruins.
1975:'Brother... I had not hoped to be called that again. Like I said, 'tis a long tale, and you be alive and wantin' to be on your way. So I can tell ya the gist of it, if you like?'
1976:Say that you have time to hear the full story.
1977:Yes, say that you'd like the short version.
1978:'This city was once the marvel of the underkingdoms, and me, I was a young and ambitious master's apprentice. Sure, I was good, but I was mostly cocky and thought myself touched by the great smiths.'
1979:Say that's often the way of youth.
1980:'Like I said, 'tis a long tale, and you be alive and wantin' to be on your way. So I can tell ya the gist of it, if you like?'
1981:'Heh, well, I'll be honest with ya, laddie, I pulled you here because I'm a selfish sort. {}{}{}{}Like I said, 'tis a long tale, and you be alive and wantin' to be on your way. So I can tell ya the gist of it, if you like?'
1982:'Aye, you're right there. I boasted my skill and climbed the ladder, oh, I did, laddies. And in time my master was so sick of me he sent me off to the surface to learn and prove my worth.'
1983:So you lived up top, with us?
1984:'That I did. I lived through the dark times, and in time, I forgot about the underkingdoms, or at least I no longer felt the call. I grew ever more ambitious and proud. Calling myself the master smith of all times, bragging about how I was the best.'
1985:Continue.
1986:'I got... entangled in some, well, personal stuff, and to cut this tale short, a demon calling himself the treasurer called my bluff.'
1987:Bluff? So you weren't that great after all?
1988:'Bah, I was. Still am! But... well, he played me, okay? He commissioned me to craft a runic mithril cage. It was to be delicate, intricate and light, yet sturdy enough to hold even a dragon! It was to be a masterpiece, you see?'
1989:'Impressive.' Wait for him to continue.
1990:'Ah, my laddie, it was, it is, a thing of beauty and skill! But here's the snag. The creature didn't just commission me.'
1991:Oh?
1992:'He made me a bet. Said if I do it in three months, I will get riches and recognition beyond my dreams. If I lose, however, I will forever serve as his smith.'{}{}
1993:So you lost?
1994:'Aye, the damned trickster. Just as I was about to finish, he stole a vital piece of runic stone that was needed to complete the cage. Without it, I could not finish, for the cage will never hold a dragon.'
1995:Isn't that cheating?
1996:'Tell that to the bloody demon! The rules never said he couldn't interfere. Or, as he put it, 'You should have watched your materials better, old man!' Oh, that fiend!'
1997:So why are you here?
1998:'I know where the fiend dwells, but I cannot go, obviously. If ya go and kill it, I will be free! And thankful, of course. My smithy will die with my spirit, but if you do the deed, you will find abundant gifts from me in the rubble!{}{}{}{}And here, have this as an incentive.'{}{}
1999:Decline, loot this place, and leave.
2000:'Well, I was a master blacksmith in my youth, or so I believed. I boasted and boasted, and in search of more knowledge I even ventured outside the underkingdoms.'{}{}
2001:'Aye, I did. I lived through the dark times and had me a good life, but then came the demon with his trickster ways.'
2002:Right, as demons usually are?
2003:'It made me a bet -- make him a wondrous cage light as feather, pretty as an elf, and strong enough to hold a dragon. Do it in three months and fame and riches would be mine!'
2004:So naturally, you took the bait?
2005:'Right you are again. The little bastard stole a vital part on the night before I finished. And so, I am bound to serve it for an eternity.'
2006:Among the rubble and dust of the fallen main hall, behind the remains of a giant anvil, you find the passage leading deeper into the city, where you discover the master smith's forge.{}{}{}{}The place is abandoned, cleared out not by looters but likely by the owner, although you spot several tools and resources you can still salvage.{}{}{}{}You hear a strange rummaging in the corner, and you realise you're being watched by some unliving!
2007:The bones are crushed and lifeless, as they should be. You are free to loot the forge now.
2008:You are defeated and forced to flee.
2009:You come to a place where some kind of craftsman's workstation must have stood once. Ornate tables hold the remains of odd tools and trinkets. Many wonderful stone and metal statues still stand here. 
2010:[Dwarf]An artisan workshop. Take only what is left lying around. Do not touch the statues.
2011:Gather whatever you can salvage here.
2012:You gather up what you can, but when you pilfer the statues, a mechanism comes to life that locks you in the chamber!
2013:[Smith]Find the opening handle and leave.
2014:Try to figure out how to open it.
2015:Bash it open.
2016:No matter how hard you hit, the stone remains unmovable.
2017:After many hours, you finally open the doors and leave the wretched place. {}{}{}{}The rest of the ruins have already been scavenged.
2018:It took what felt like days to figure out the opening sequence. By the time the doors open, you are exhausted, hungry, and ill. Worse yet, as you prepare to leave, you see the doors start to close again, so you run out, abandoning most of what you looted. {}{}
2019:You come to a closed metal-clad door. Upon the stones in the wall you see many runes carved deep into the surface.
2020:[Runemaster]Speak the passphrase and enter the runesmith's workshop.
2021:Try to break the magic binding this door shut.
2022:You have no folk skilled enough in mysticism. Leave.
2023:Within the chamber you see a wide, empty space. Whatever was here has been looted or taken by the owner.{}{}{}{}Strangely, however, you find a stone mannequin wearing robes and holding a dwarven weapon. There is a note: 'You got in, so help yourself.'
2024:Take the present and leave.
2025:You cannot enter, and the runes seep some life force out of you, forcing you to flee.
2026:Alas, you do not find anything. Perhaps it was destroyed or you were mistaken. Tired, you leave the ruins.
2027:The dwarf sighs, then disappears. The forge is empty.
2028:Loot it and leave.
2029:You discover the ruins of an ancient human cemetery, one where burial was clearly the custom. There are gravestones with faded markings and even some large stone crypts. 
2030:Near the gravestones that tell the tale of the old days, you find a spot where a single slab of sandstone lies with some very faint and unreadable markings on it. Something draws your attention towards it.
2031:The placement of the stone and the faded markings look to you like some sort of warding symbols, suggesting that whoever was buried here was an undesirable, but also feared. Were the wards meant to protect whoever lies here, or the other way around? Alas, this is unclear. 
2032:Search for anything usable.
2033:This seems likely to be a place of burial for outcasts, criminals, those who were unwanted in a community, or perhaps those too poor to get a proper burial. As you get closer, you get a fleeting feeling of unease - dark magics could be in play here...
2034: This seems likely to be a place of burial for outcasts, criminals, those who were unwanted in a community, or perhaps those too poor to get a proper burial.
2035:'You, you there, live one! Come here. I need a favour and you seem the sort to listen.'{}{}{}{}You realise the sound is coming from the stone slab. As you turn towards it, you can see the outlines of a ghostly figure.
2036:[Ghost]Tell him to speak plainly, without the drama. Ask him why he is here.
2037:[Goblin shaman]You sense this ghost is bound to the gravestone. Ask him why.
2038:Ask him what his problem is.
2039:Leave him to his fate.
2040:'Well, you know, cemeteries, dead folk, after the gates to the underworlds were shut for centuries and then that god of yours, Veles, disappeared, we're quite overcrowded here, you know.{}{}{}{}But say, ghost to ghost, will you help me out?'
2041:Say that you see he is stuck here, and ask why.
2042:'A specialist, great. Yes, I am stuck here because some vengeful sod trapped my poor spirit in this place. Dark magic, poor taste, you pick...'
2043:Tell him you see through his lie. Ask for the truth.
2044:Agree to try a ritual to free him.
2045:Agree to smash the gravestone and see if that frees him.
2046:You break the spirit free of its bonds, and as it is set free, you see an evil glimmer in its eye. Several other wraith-like spirits appear and join their long-lost master.{}{}{}{}An air of darkness follows the ghost as it disappears, leaving you cursed.
2047:You fail to perform the ritual and the spirit shifts into an angry wraith. 'Useless lumps of meat!'{}{}{}{}You feel weakened, but perhaps it is good that the ghost remained trapped.
2048:'Oh, fine, fine - yes, I was a wretched soul. A murderous villain I was called, damned to eternity shackled to this stone. Can you imagine the boredom? Just let me leave and I will reward you -- I promise.'
2049:Strengthen the ritual to make sure he stays where he is. 
2050:You strengthen the ritual binding the spirit here. It skulks away into the shadows, unable to do anything to stop you. You feel a wave of good energy fall upon you - an aftereffect of the original spell, you think.
2051:You fail to strengthen the ritual and feel depleted from the attempt. {}{}{}{}The ghost is angered and lashes out at you, forcing you to leave.
2052:'You know, in the old days, I would have thrown a curse on you and gathered my dark minions to reap death and destruction on the lands. But all my time in solitude taught me a lesson. I will serve you awhile instead.'
2053:You kill the ghost, but you suspect it will eventually return here. Still, it is gone for now.
2054:The ghost defeats you and leaves you cursed as you run away from its range.
2055:You smash the gravestone to pieces, but the ghost remains bound to this place. Clearly, brute force will not break this curse.{}{}{}{}The ghost skulks away, cursing at you, and you see a glimmer of malice in its dead eyes. You feel your spirit fatigued from the effort.
2056:'I guess you could call my troubles your typical ghost conundarumum, eh, problem. We... I mean, I am stuck here because some vengeful sod trapped my poor spirit in this place.'
2057:You enter an ancient human graveyard. Here, you feel the presence of otherworldly beings lingering in dark corners, but they do not react to you in any way.
2058:Good. Look for useful resources without disturbing the dead.
2059:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. There's some rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}You do, however, find a faded pentagram and a dead body that is not buried. Among its rotten belongings, you find a map drawn on a piece of leather.
2060:Take the map and leave. 
2061:Take the map and leave.
2062:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. There's some rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}You find one large crypt that could still hold some mysteries, but you'd need to move a large slab of stone to get in.
2063:You're strong enough to move the slab without much effort.
2064:Try to move the slab.
2065:You move the slab and enter a dark crypt. {}{}{}{}As you step inside, candles light up along your path and, within, you find a stone coffin. Around it, in various alcoves, you see statues wearing jewellery, ornamental objects, and even ceremonial weaponry.  Some of it is likely too old to use, but some can be salvaged. 
2066:Sneak in and loot the place quickly.
2067:Attack whatever lies in the coffin.
2068:The crypt remains untouched and the effort leaves you exhausted.
2069:You feel the air tense around you and a dread runs down your spine, but you sneak in and grab as much as you can before anything happens. 
2070:Good, take the stuff and leave.
2071:You feel the air tense around you and a dread runs down your spine. You see nothing, but you feel a dark curse attacking you!
2072:Defend yourselves.
2073:Whatever dark force tried breaking you, it fails and retreats from whence it came.{}{}
2074:You open the crypt and stab whatever was inside. It looks like a very dead body and now it is, er, deader.
2075:Good. Loot the place and leave.
2076:The striga that lay within met its true death. The tomb lies open for your looting.
2077:You are beaten badly, your blood drawn, your souls weakened, but you manage to run away before death followed.
2078:The cemetery looks like it's been looted many times before. There's some rubble and dirt.{}{}{}{}You also notice a creature burrowing under one of the gravestones.{}{}
2079:Take a closer look to try to identify it.
2080:Leave it be.
2081:[Unliving]You feel a weaker form of the unliving here. Try to dominate it into servitude.
2082:These are unliving vermin!
2083:Kill them!
2084:Lure them away with some food and a bit of your blood. Then loot the grave they were digging.
2085:The rats beat you badly and you are forced to flee. Some of you are infected by the unliving vermin.
2086:A dark, foreboding force clasps at your souls, corrupting them from within. You feel soiled, violated. {}{}{}{}You manage to force yourself out of this place, but not without scars.
2087:You move the slab and enter a dark crypt. {}{}{}{}As you step inside, candles light up along your path and, within, you find a stone coffin. Around it, in various alcoves, you see statues wearing jewellery, ornamental objects, and even ceremonial weaponry.  Some of it is likely too old to use, but some can be salvaged. {}{}
2088:Alas, for one of you, the wounds were deadly -- or so it seemed, until you rose up as a nightwalker, a striga. Fortunately, your connection to the cosmic pantheon remains strong, so you are free to follow your own path again.
2089:Your plan works, but the stuff you loot is infected with some nasty rat disease.
2090:You dominate the unliving rats swarming the grave, but they are too scared for servitude. They simply scamper off into the shadows.
2091:You enter an ancient grave site, long forgotten by mankind. Among old, decrepit gravestones, you find a large crypt, crushed by a fallen tree. The entrance stands ajar and cold darkness looms within...
2092:No time to explore. Just leave.
2093:Within the crypt is a single stone coffin. The chamber is dark and covered in dust, decay, and spiderwebs, but you notice a pentagram carved into the floor and a thick silver chain that holds the coffin secure.{}{}
2094:Consider this setup carefully.
2095:[Striga]You sense something familiar. Get in closer to have a look.
2096:Take the silver chain and leave quickly before anything comes out.
2097:Open the crypt and see what happens. Be ready for a fight.
2098:Some of the symbols used on the pentagram and the chain point towards an unliving fiend being laid here, most likely a striga.{}{}
2099:Use a magic ritual of your own to strengthen the pentagram's magic, leaving you free to take the silver chain.
2100:Create a protective circle of fire and take the silver chain, then open the coffin to see what lies inside.
2101:You study the pentagram and find that it was infused with the power of light to hold something of great darkness within. {}{}{}{}Considering the presence of the silver chain, you believe an unliving creature may lie within. 
2102:Better just leave it be.
2103:Try to figure out how to secure the coffin without the chain -- it is good silver, after all.
2104:Open the coffin and kill whatever lies inside. It must be weakened, anyway!
2105:Use a ritual to protect yourselves, and then attack the fiend!
2106:You determine that the load-bearing columns in this crypt are barely standing, and that with a little effort, you can collapse this place on your way out. That way, whatever lies inside should be killed and you'll have the silver.{}{}{}{}In theory...
2107:Do it. 
2108:Do it.
2109:There doesn't seem to be a way to get the silver chain safely. 
2110:Just leave.
2111:Open the coffin and kill whatever is inside!
2112:You create a ring of fire, hold on to the chain, and open the crypt. Within is a dried-up striga master, his eyes red with hunger and rage, and the iron and silver chains holding him broken. You have no more than a few breaths before he lunges at you!
2113:Close the lid and put the chain around it!
2114:Kill the striga!
2115:Take the chain and run for it!
2116:You shudder in pain when you come close to the protective runes. There is no doubt -- a fellow striga is trapped within, one likely still driven by bloodlust. 
2117:Wild strigas are dangerous. Better to put it out of its misery. Kill it while it is weakened.
2118:Open the coffin and talk to the striga. 
2119:While your striga friend stands back, you dismantle the protection and free what sleeps within.{}{}{}{}A thirsty bloodsucker emerges, hissing, 'Blood, blood!'{}{}{}{}It will be tough to talk to the striga in this state. 
2120:You are supreme. Dominate him!
2121:Convince him you are a friend.
2122:'Yes, oh great one, I serve your superior will.'{}{} {}{}Despite its words, you know a striga won't stay obedient for long.{}{}{}{}He leaves you all his equipment as a sign of honour, though.
2123:Bid it to leave you a servant in its stead.
2124:The creature does not attack you, but scampers off into the distance.{}{}{}{}You are free to take the loot.
2125:Good, now leave this place.
2126:The striga's eyes turn red, its posture grows, and you feel a presence of greatness and power. You kneel before your superior and allow it to taste your blood as tribute.{}{}{}{}When you regain your willpower, the master is gone, and you feel your blood corrupted.{}{}
2127:'No more, oh great one, no more. I live to serve.'{}{}{}{}The striga turns into its bat form and remains to serve you.
2128:Good, take the loot and leave.
2129:'No more, oh great one, no more. I live to serve.'{}{}{}{}You beat the striga into submission and can now call upon its services.
2130:At first it seems the coffin holds nothing more than a dried-up striga body, but before you know it, you hear a voice in your head: 'Kneel before me, vermin! Serve my appetites!'{}{}
2131:Try to resist this power!
2132:Your faith is strong, and you're not easily broken. {}{}Attack it!
2133:Your faith is strong, and you're not easily broken. Run away!
2134:Obey the call.
2135:You were too slow and clumsy and while you were busy looting the chain, a powerful striga escaped, draining some of your blood on its way out!
2136:Damn it. Leave.
2137:You resist, and the beast runs away in fear, leaving you free to loot the crypt.
2138:You thought you were safe, but your ritual clearly failed, as a striga climbs out of its crypt and sucks your blood before running away!
2139:The striga almost gets you, but fortunately it's only able to slash at you a few times before you run out of the cemetery. For some reason, it cannot follow.
2140:You open the lid and face a striga master, its eyes red with hunger, its claws ready to rip your body apart. {}{}{}{}You stab it repeatedly before it can rise fully, but it put up a fight and left you bleeding.
2141:As soon as you enter the grave site, you feel something is amiss. Many of the gravestones are crushed and the earth beneath them has been moved. {}{}{}{}It could be grave robbers, but it could be something more...
2142:You go in closer and notice a figure sitting on a gravestone, crying. The figure shifts its shape from a black cat to a mouse to a ghostly visage of a woman and back again. 
2143:[Demon or zerca]Try to figure out what creature this may be.
2144:[Magic users]You sense some magic here. Take a closer look.
2145:[Harmony]Your connection to the divine tingles. Time to investigate.
2146:[Nature]You feel something unnatural. Investigate.
2147:Black cats and mice are often signs of witchery. Best approach with caution.
2148:Black cats and mice are often signs of witchery. Kill the creature!
2149:You spot a couple of unliving corpses coming in and out of a crypt. There may be more inside, as you see many tracks around the place.
2150:[Unliving]These seem to be awakened, like you, or at least acting with more purpose than usual. Go in to talk to them. 
2151:Drawing on your special rare knowledge, you recognise what's happening. These forms together suggest that this may be a dola demon. They are usually guardians, especially fond of protecting young ones and bringing good fortune to those they choose. It is odd to find one here, alone.
2152:Ask what the dola is doing here.
2153:'You, you're living... good... or no? No, bad... they will feed on you! Oh, no!'{}{}{}{}You hear movement accompanied by unnatural groans. You soon see the first unliving bodies looming behind a crypt. They haven't noticed you yet.{}{}
2154:Figure out a way to wake up the dola and remind it of its duty to protect.
2155:The binding of these unliving is very weak and fresh. Use a cleansing ritual to break the bond and thus destroy them.
2156:Cats and mice are often familiars of witches or demons. More disturbingly, you sense a growing weave of magic coming your way. {}{}{}{}Judging from the setting, you suspect that the unliving roam these grounds!{}{}
2157:Speak out to see if anyone hides here.
2158:Attack the creature and whatever minions it may have.
2159:You sense the overwhelming power of harmony, twisted and unnatural. Something is very wrong here; the laws of harmony and nature are being broken!{}{}{}{}The figure sees you and speaks: 'You, you're living... good... or no? No, bad... they will feed on you! Oh, no!'{}{}
2160:Perform a dance of nature and harmony to try to bring this creature back from its torment.
2161:Leave this place of unnatural turmoil.
2162:'A dola, dola... yes. Oh, no, what happened here? I, I just wanted my charge to be safe, living, but he wasn't. He was here, so cold, so I tried, but they all come out wrong!'
2163:So she made the unliving?
2164:'I just, I gave them my light... but it went wrong, it made them come to life, but all wrong... and I tried and tried...{}{}{}{}Strike me down. It should take them too. I see no other way.'{}{}
2165:Agree to her request. Strike her down.
2166:You know a simple ritual to banish the dola without killing it, but the magic is known to backfire sometimes. Still, it's a risk worth taking.
2167:Kill the unliving only. Tell the dola to leave here and never do this again.
2168:The dola dies quietly, and with it, the unliving bodies that were coming your way collapse.{}{}{}{}The remaining light of the dola leaves a blessing upon you. 
2169:The ritual banished the dola, but it did not destroy the unliving. A small group remains, frenzied and bloodthirsty. Fortunately, they run off into the distance.
2170:The ritual works and the dola slowly dissolves into light energy. The unliving corpses collapse on the ground. Before vanishing, the dola leaves a blessing upon you.
2171:The ritual seems to work as the unliving collapse on the ground and the dola begins to disappear, but you see her form twist and turn in silent agony!{}{}{}{}You feel a curse upon you.
2172:The dola suddenly looks more composed, tears in her eyes. She speaks: 'I just, I gave them my light... but it went wrong. It made them come to life, but all wrong... and I tried and tried...{}{}{}{}Strike me down. It should take them too. I see no other way.'{}{}
2173:If it is the only way, we must do it. Kill the dola.
2174:'A dola... I remember not what that means. My charges, my charges are walking again, and now they must feed. You'd better leave...'{}{}{}{}You notice figures moving in the shadows, slowly but surely making their way towards you.
2175:The ritual works and the unliving collapse where they stand. The creature who summoned them cries out as if in pain.{}{}{}{}'Noooo! My charges, dead. I failed... again... worry not my dears, I will make you right again...'{}{}
2176:Kill the demon as well before she summons more unliving. 
2177:Bind the demon to your service with magic. This is risky, and may end up cursing you but it could work.
2178:Just leave this place. 
2179:The ritual fails and the unliving corpses move towards you. The demon who seems to control them cries but does nothing to stop them. 
2180:You kill the unliving and find a human-looking child crying: 'Noooo, mamma, papa, brothers!'{}{}{}{}When you try to talk to the child, it doesn't know what happened, only that its family is gone.
2181:Comfort the child and take it with you.
2182:You walk up to the child, but it hisses at you and runs off into a small tunnel. Leave.
2183:Apart from the two corpses you saw, you spot three more that look like teenagers. The unliving are doing various chores around the crypt -- gardening, bringing in firewood, and sweeping. {}{}{}{}You also spot someone sitting inside the crypt, playing with dolls on the floor. It's a girl of no more than five. 
2184:Greet your fellow unliving and ask why they have a living child with them.
2185:You try to comfort the child, but it is inconsolable. To your dismay, the next night you find it died in its sleep, and its body looks as if it's decades old. {}{}{}{}But you do feel a blessing from an unknown source fall upon you.
2186:Damn. Bury the child and continue onwards. 
2187:One of the unliving stops and turns to you. It smiles and says in a harsh, throaty voice:{}{}{}{}'Family, yes. Our baby brought us back, now we are a family, forever and ever and a day, and forever we can play...{}{}{}{}Help... please... forever like this...'{}{}
2188:The little girl hops out of the crypt and frowns when she sees you, saying:{}{}{}{}'You're strangers! Go away or I'll have my daddy and brothers eat you!'{}{}{}{}The girl's eyes are grey and empty, but you see a doll she carries has human eyes that glisten with bright light.
2189:Keep listening.
2190:Kill the girl.
2191:'The ground shook and shook, and mummy and daddy and my brothers were shook to death. I cried and cried and a lady came from where the ground shook. She gave me the dolly and said I can have my family back! Now they are back, and we play forever and a day!'
2192:Kill the unliving.
2193:Leave the odd family be. It's not for you to judge.
2194:Convince the child to destroy the doll.
2195:You kill the unliving and the dola cries out in pain, but she too disappears, whispering only: 'Perhaps this is best...'
2196:The act of violence does not sit well with harmony. Accept the penance and leave.
2197:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. {}{}{}{}
2198:The act of violence does not sit well with harmony. Accept the defeat and leave.
2199:'So the dolly is bad? Making mummy and daddy ill? Okay, then...'{}{}{}{}She hands you the doll. You destroy it and the unliving fall down, their unnatural life leaving them. The father nods at you in thanks.{}{}{}{}The girl bursts out crying uncontrollably.
2200:You walk up to the child, but she hisses at you and runs off into a small tunnel.
2201:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. 
2202:'No, no, no! Now go away!'{}{}{}{}She throws a tantrum and the unliving get agitated. They grunt and walk towards you aggressively.
2203:You swing your weapon once and chop the girl's face off with a clean swipe.{}{}{}{}The unliving stand there for a second, staring at you in disbelief. The mother falls on the floor behind her child. The girl then rises -- unliving too. You get the sense the family may still have mixed feelings about you.
2204:Leave before they decide to attack.
2205:Demand payment for freeing them from the little girl's strange dominion. 
2206:The father speaks up: 'You harm my little girl... but now we feel... hmm... free from something, able to think again. So yes, have this as thanks. But please, go now, my wife may not see it as I do...'
2207:The unliving charge at you!
2208: The binding fails. You leave, but as you do, you hear the dola scream once more, then her voice changes and you see angry wraiths roaming the land.
2209:You discover an elven sacred ground, committed to the memory of the dead.
2210:You step in closer and hear a faint rustling of leaves. You look up and see bows aimed at you. {}{}{}{}'What do you seek in this sacred place?'{}{}
2211:[Forest folk]State you have come for the blessings of the memory tree, as is your right.
2212:[Harmony, Nature or Light]Bow in respect and say you have come seeking wisdom from the elves.
2213:[Orc or turmoil]You feel strangely weakened standing in the presence of the tree. Say you come in peace.
2214:Attack the elves and pillage the tree.
2215:Say you are merely here out of curiosity.
2216:'Forgive our caution. Some of our kin has moved far from the light and remembers our ways not. Come to the memory tree, then, and ask for your blessings.'
2217:Thank them.
2218:'Since you are here, we have a boon to ask. {}{}{}{}A corrupted spirit invades this sacred place, and we are bound not to leave this tree. {}{}{}{}The spirit resides not far away and can only be dealt with there. Will you help? All you need to do is carry this branch to the place. It will trap the evil spirit and prevent it from pestering the memory tree.'
2219:Agree to help. Tell them to point you to where the spirit lies.
2220:Ask why they haven't done it yet.
2221:'You follow the right path. You may proceed.'{}{}{}{}You stand by the memory tree and meditate. You hear a faint yet moving song in your head, and the words seem to come from every crystal that hangs before you.
2222:Bow in thanks for the blessing.
2223:You stand by the memory tree and meditate. You hear a faint yet moving song in your head, and the words seem to come from every crystal that hangs before you.
2224:'We can deal with the matter at the next guard change, but that will not be for several cycles yet. It is an annoyance; thus, we saw an opportunity to be rid of it.'
2225:Agree to help.
2226:You come to the place and see a spirit form intertwined with a young sapling. You feel no dark magic from it, but you do sense a lot of anger and fear.{}{}{}{}This is clearly a forest spirit gone rogue rather than a lost soul. Perhaps this is why the elves wished it captured, not killed.
2227:[Goblin shaman]The spirit is in a volatile form. You can use a ritual to try to bind it to your service.
2228:Use the elf branch.
2229:Kill the spirit instead.
2230:[Forest demon]Give some of your own spirit to help heal this forest creature.
2231:The forest spirit twists in agony from your ritual and transforms into a wraith, but it will serve you now.{}{}{}{}There is an ominous rustling of leaves and you sense a curse fall upon you, likely for breaking your word.
2232:The forest spirit responds to your bidding. It transforms into its demon form and will now serve you. {}{}{}{}There is an ominous rustling of leaves, and you think you'd better leave the forest before the elven guards decide you broke your word.
2233:You bind the spirit and return it to the guards. They thank you and leave you gifts from the memory tree.
2234:You kill the forest spirit, or rather spirits that proved to be pineconettes. {}{}{}{}You feel a growing, heavy stare of the forest itself upon you.{}{}
2235:You fail to kill the spirit and you feel a growing, heavy stare of the forest itself upon you.{}{}{}{}You get the sense that you are lucky the elf guards cannot leave their post.
2236:'Strange words coming from you. You follow a path of turmoil and warmongering. It is not welcome in this place. {}{}{}{}If you wish to stay, you may be judged harshly by the memories and risk your spirit, but we will allow you to touch the tree if you wish.'
2237:Agree to be tested.
2238:You reach for the tree and feel its energy reaching back. It is full of light and calmness, serenity... dull, stifling, suffocating, tugging at the very fibre of turmoil within you!{}{}{}{}You manage to step back, but you feel a deep burning within. 
2239:You reach for the tree and feel its energy reaching back. It is full of light and calmness, serenity. {}{}{}{}One of the crystals floats towards you and shares its wisdom with you.
2240:Great. Pay your respects and leave.
2241:You kill the guardians and try to loot the tree of its crystals, but most simply turn to dust when you touch them.
2242:You kill the guardians and try to loot the tree of its crystals, but each one you touch turns to dust, and you feel a sickness befall you.
2243:You lose and although the elves let you leave, you feel a heavy curse upon you.
2244:You kill the guardians and try to loot the tree of its crystals, but each one you touch simply turns to dust.{}{}{}{}With every disappearing crystal, you feel a stain on your elven soul.
2245:The ritual fails, and the creature dies in great torment. The woodland close to it withers away also. You get the sense that you are lucky the elf guards cannot leave their post.
2246:Something went wrong. The branch twisted into a dried-up piece of coal, and the spirit seems to have grown more unruly. When you report back, the guards nod solemnly:{}{}{}{}'You did what you could. We should not have asked this of a stranger. Fare thee well, traveller. We must focus on protecting the memory tree now until our guard change.'
2247:Bow and leave.
2248:'You are a stranger here. Still, the memory tree is a place of contemplation for all.{}{}{}{}If you wish to stay, you may be judged harshly by the memories and risk your spirit, but we will allow you to touch the tree if you wish.'
2249:You sacrifice your own spirit and the woodland creature slowly regains control. 
2250:You come closer to the tree and look at the various crystals beaming among the leaves. {}{}{}{}You hear a faint song as if whispered from within the tree itself. 
2251:Listen to the song but stay vigilant.
2252:Listen to the beautiful song.
2253:The melody is entrancing, but you know this may be dangerous. You focus and see a ghostly figure sitting on a branch and looking at you with a pleasant smile:{}{}{}{}'So your will is not a plaything. Good. What seek you here, stranger?'
2254:[Elf]Welcome the forest kin as one of your own. 
2255:Say you have come to admire the beauty of this place.
2256:Say these crystals looked abandoned, so you wished to have them.
2257:Attack the apparition!
2258:You get lost in the song and don't even realise that you no longer see the tree. In fact, what tree? {}{}{}{}You hear a final whisper in your head.{}{}{}{}'Weary travellers, hear my song, and may your spirit remain ever strong.'{}{}{}{}You feel weakened and disoriented, yet you also feel positive.
2259:'Ah, of course, my apologies. Physical senses in this form are still a mystery to me. What do you seek, brethren? Have you come for the ever-sleep?'
2260:Say that you are not yet ready to leave the physical plane, merely here to pay your respects.
2261:Tell them you are young and do not recall the ever-sleep.
2262:Remind them you are forest kin, but not elven. Ask about this ever-sleep.
2263:'I came for the ever-sleep, but my soul was tainted with darkness. As such, it could not join in the light. Instead, I am stuck here, guarding the memory tree until I am cleansed.'
2264:Ask if they need aid.
2265:Yes, you have heard of your kin cursed by darkness, shadow kin. Wish them good fortune in cleansing their taint and ask if you can obtain a blessing from the memory tree.
2266:Apologise for your ignorance, but ask what the memory tree is.
2267:'I thank you, brethren, but I do not. The cleansing must proceed unaided for it to be true. But I feel that you follow the path of the mortal gods instead of ours. How odd.' {}{}
2268:Confirm that you follow the path of the cosmic pantheon, for they are guardians of balance. Affirm that this is still the goal of all elves.
2269:'True, you are elven even if somewhat misguided, and thus I can offer you a boon. Pick one of the memory crystals and take its blessings with you.{}{}{}{}I will also allow you to reach for the ones up top, which carry greater blessings, but you must face a challenge to take them.'
2270:Accept the memory crystal and say you will not face the challenge this day. Thank him and depart.
2271:Thank him for the offer and face the challenge.
2272:'You are elven, and you speak plainly with me, and thus I can offer you a boon. Pick one of the memory crystals and take its blessings with you.{}{}{}{}I will also allow you to reach for the ones up top, which carry greater blessings, but you must face a challenge to take them.'
2273:'Such desires can lead you astray, young one. Be wary of them.{}{}{}{}Yet I do not sense malice in your intent, so I will allow you to face a challenge of your wits or spirits. If either proves to my liking, I will grant you the boon from the memory tree.'
2274:What is this memory tree?
2275:Agree to face the spirit challenge.
2276:Agree to face the mental challenge.
2277:'The memory tree is a place of remembrance for those elven souls who chose ever-sleep. Before joining the light, they cry a single tear for the material lives they lived here, and they leave those tears to be remembered by. This is what you see here. {}{}{}{}The tears can grant boons if given by a guardian willingly.'
2278:'Seeking knowledge is not a matter for forgiveness, but admiration. {}{}{}{}The memory tree is a place of remembrance for those elven souls who chose ever-sleep. Before joining the light, they cry a single tear for the material lives they lived here, and they leave those tears to be remembered by. This is what you see here. {}{}{}{}The tears can grant boons if given by a guardian willingly.'
2279:Ask if they need aid in their cleansing.
2280:Wish them good fortune in cleansing their taint and ask if you can obtain a blessing from the memory tree.
2281:'This is the consequence of following these mortal gods, my young brethren. Be cautious on your path.{}{}{}{}The ever-sleep is when we decide to shed our material shells and rejoin the ever-light from whence we came.'
2282:You attack the ghostly figure, but all you hear is laughter. Instead of the ghost, the forest comes to life and strikes back at you!
2283:You attack the ghostly figure to no avail and find yourselves assailed by strong magic!
2284:Defend yourselves!
2285:'A bold claim indeed, stranger! And pray, why would I allow such a deed? These are no trinkets, but tears of those gone to their ever-sleep. Will you defile their memory?'
2286:Admit you were in search of resources.
2287:'No. Your boldness has endeared itself to my soul. You seek to survive, and I sympathise. I will allow you to take a challenge of spirit, a hard one. If you pass, you may be granted a boon. Otherwise, leave here, now.'
2288:The memory tree deems you unworthy, and your soul feels wounded from its rejection.
2289:You have defeated the guardians that rose to fight you. The memory tree stands unguarded.
2290:You are satisfied with your win. Time to leave.
2291:Take the crystals from the tree. They may be worth something.
2292:Take the crystals and chop down the tree.
2293:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. You feel the forest's anger upon you.
2294:You come closer to the tree and realise that out of one of the roots grows a figure of an elf -- a wooden statue, lifelike yet clearly static. It has several ornaments made of precious stones and metals, including a tiara, some rings, and a decorative chest piece. 
2295:You feel your divine connection pulling you towards the statue. Touch it. 
2296:[Elf]Sing the ever-sleep song to soothe your elven brethren on their journey.
2297:You sense faint remnants of life within the woodwork -- a spirit almost crossed over, perhaps? Meditate in respect for this soul.
2298:[Dwarf]As statues go, this one was not made by mortal hands. Examine the craft.
2299:Take the precious stuff out.
2300:Pay your respects and leave.
2301:When you touch the statue, you feel it tugging at your bond to the gods. {}{}{}{}There is an emptiness inside the sleeping elf, and your domain seems to correspond to what is missing. You feel that you would be able to feed this emptiness, but it may be risky. 
2302:Give some of your spirit so that this soul may cross over in peace.
2303:Pillage the goods from the statue.
2304:Do not offer your spirit, but pay your respects before leaving here.
2305:The carving is too delicate, the design too imperfect in its absolute perfection. This must the sacred elven ever-sleep. Like some of your own ancient kin who fall to stone upon death, the elves are said to choose their time of death and turn into statues before their spirit forms float away.
2306:Create a small stone carving and add it to this statue in honour of the soul that is passing.
2307:You try to take the statue apart, but its eyes open and a ray of stifling bright light engulfs you in its burning blaze.
2308:Try to resist.
2309:You know this statue to be an elf who entered the ever-sleep but did not shed their physical shell entirely. The elven kin can remain for centuries in this state, still aware of what happens around them and able to awaken if needed but resting and contemplating at the same time.{}{}{}{}The ever-sleep song soothes such sleepers and tells them of your own life path. 
2310:Continue the song before leaving.
2311:Brethren or not, they have precious stones. Loot the sleeping elf.
2312:You ravage the sleeping elf and see their face fall to sadness. Your spirit sinks at your deeds, but you get the precious stones.{}{}
2313:You feel an energy trying to escape from this plane, but you also sense a stifling force keeping it unnaturally trapped.{}{}{}{}You can attempt a ritual to help free this soul, but if you fail, it could harm you.
2314:Attempt the ritual.
2315:As you touch the stone to try to defile it, the figure opens its eyes, gasps, and turns to silver ash.{}{}{}{}Your elven souls are wounded by the disrespect you showed, but you gather up some silver...
2316:The light scorches your soul and leaves it scarred. You are forced to run before you lose yourself to the blaze.
2317:As you touch the stone to try to defile it, the figure opens its eyes, gasps, and turns to silver ash.{}{}{}{}Any elven souls are wounded by the disrespect you showed, but you gather up some silver...
2318:You open your spirit and, through the connection of the divine, the force flows into the sleeping elven soul. The statue looks at peace and then slowly, before your eyes, it turns to silver ash. {}{}{}{}You feel that you can take whatever the soul left for you without being disrespectful.
2319:Your ritual disrupts whatever held the soul here. The statue looks at peace and then slowly, before your eyes, it turns to silver ash. {}{}{}{}You feel that you can take whatever the soul left for you without being disrespectful.
2320:Your ritual backfires, and you see a blaze of bright light scorch the statue. Its fleeting soul gasps in a mute scream before it disappears forever. {}{}{}{}Any who know of elven cultures are struck by the finality of this death.
2321:You discover an orc burial ground. The setup is simple and pragmatic. There are funeral pyres and signs of a feast. Some pyres have ornaments and even basic weaponry, but they are clearly ornamental, rather than the good stuff.
2322:You move in closer. One of the funeral pyres seems like it may be fresh, as dark smoke lingers still.{}{}
2323:[Light or Harmony]Your god's domain feels weakened here, as if the world is swirling with turmoil and darkness! Focus on your domain to investigate this. 
2324:[Turmoil or Magic]Your domain is strong here and you feel a pull towards the dark smoke, yet you know it may be perilous. Open yourself up and try to sense what you're facing.
2325:[Orc witch]The funeral pyre has the ornaments of a witch and the smoke is not smoke at all. Prepare a ritual to approach it safely. 
2326:[Orc]The funeral pyre has ornaments for a witch burial -- better approach carefully.
2327:[Magic user] There's a definite sense of magic here -- dark, chaotic, unsettling magic. Prepare wards before moving closer.
2328:Move in closer.
2329:Seems dangerous - better leave. 
2330:You are now sure the smoke is a manifestation of darkness in its pure, unnatural form. It will seek to corrupt or destroy anything it touches, and it is reaching out to you!{}{}{}{}Since the power of your domain is directly opposed to this force, you can try to destroy it completely, but it will be hard.
2331:Unnatural darkness like this cannot be left to run amok. Prepare a ritual of light and harmony to lock it away!
2332:This fight is too great for now. Leave this place. 
2333:The smoke is clearly the darkness itself, and it vibrates with turmoil and dark magic, seeking to be released or devour whatever comes its way.{}{}{}{}This manifestation is unnaturally strong and can be very dangerous, but since you are attuned to it, you could try to harness it safely. It won't be easy.
2334:Yes, try to harness the energy. 
2335:No, it will be safer and easier to lock it away.
2336:The task is too great for now. Leave this place.
2337:You pushed the dark force back and locked it away safely. {}{}{}{}You find an object of power that was causing this corruption. It is now cleansed and bound to your service.
2338:You pushed the dark force back and locked it away safely. {}{}{}{}The now-cleansed funeral pyre glows with faint green light for a second, and you sense that whoever was laid to rest here has blessed you with a gift. {}{}
2339:You failed to tame this wild power, and it lashes out at you! You manage to escape, but you feel a taint upon your soul.{}{}
2340:Your rituals worked well, capturing the rogue darkness and harnessing its turbulent force for yourself. You safely banish the rest into oblivion.
2341:A fellow witch was laid to rest here, but her magic clearly was not secured. Perhaps due to a violent death or a curse from a rival - whatever the cause, a heavy, lingering, hungry darkness lurks here.{}{}{}{}But its power can be harnessed and used with more balance. It won't be easy but it can be done. 
2342:You sense a strong concentration of darkness and know that the smoke is not smoke at all. {}{}{}{}You can try to perform a magic ritual to banish the darkness from this place. 
2343:Yes, try to banish the darkness. It cannot be left to run amok.
2344:No, this task is too hard for now. Leave.
2345:You come closer, but before long you realise you are surrounded by growing, unnatural darkness!{}{}{}{}Dread fills your souls and terror follows suit.
2346:Try to stay and fight it off!
2347:You manage to stay safe and sane, and some of you even feel your wills strengthened from the ordeal.
2348:Gather any loot and leave.
2349:From the markings, you gather that an orc witch was laid to rest here. Every orc knows it can be deadly to stick around when a witch is taken by the flame. {}{}{}{}You know which of the weapons laid here are proper and which are mere honour symbols. You grab them as is your clan-right.
2350:Perform the last journey rite quickly to pay your respects, then leave.
2351:As you examine the funeral pyres, you realise they are very old and have nothing of use, but you see a figure hunched by one of them.{}{}{}{}The figure turns to you. It is a ghost. {}{}{}{}'Oh, live ones, want to play a game?'
2352:[Orc]Reply with indignation that this is orc ground, and the only games would be blood games!
2353:Ask what game they mean.
2354:The ghost shrugs -- at least, it tries, but its ethereal body just flickers a bit. {}{}{}{}'Oh, orcs. I guess I should be all about the "Argh, stay away from our burial site, argh..."{}{}{}{}You wanna play a game or no?'
2355:Insist this is a corruption of your culture.
2356:Attack the abomination!
2357:The ghost rolls its empty eye sockets at you.{}{}{}{}'I am a spirit, a soul trapped here, tied to this place by the powers that be, formless, bored and very much aware of the futility of clinging to my old self. You'd be surprised how philosophical one gets when stuck contemplating life in a lifeless form for eternity.'{}{}
2358:And playing games is their deep philosophical answer?
2359:'You have an oak tree, ancient and tall, and you need wood for your fire. What will you take to cut it down??
2360:An axe.
2361:A witch.
2362:A friend.
2363:All three.
2364:'Simplicity is often the key to success. An axe will crush any demons or pointy ears and cut the wood.'
2365:Is that it? The game?
2366:'Yes, that was it. You may leave.'
2367:But it was stupid. What was the lesson?
2368:'The most obvious choice -- how disappointing.'
2369:'Ah, yes, you bring wisdom with you, good.'
2370:'And what, are you going to chop with her? I hear witches are rather blunt. Stupid.'
2371:'Ah, yes, clever cogs, your friend could be a woodcutter, no?'
2372:'So vague, uninspiring...'
2373:'Ah, yes, the safe answer, but wise, for the axe will cut the wood, the witch will protect you from forest magics, and a friend is always good.'
2374:'So safe, so seemingly clever... how boring.'
2375:'Why, do you think everything in life has to have logic or meaning?'
2376:And that's it?
2377:'It is.'
2378:'I ask a question and thus pass on knowledge acquired through decades in this unliving state. No trickery, I am no demon, just a game. {}{}{}{}It can teach you good or bad things about life, mind you.'
2379:'So you yield to my power, good!{}{}{}{}Now leave me be, I am in no mood for your antics.' The ghost disappears.
2380:You approach the pyres and see an orc skeleton sitting by a stone slab, rolling dice. The dice are made of bone and amber, and the cup looks like orc skin.{}{}
2381:Attack it!
2382:[Skeleton]Greet your skeletal friend and ask what it is playing.
2383:[Orc]Ask this fiend why it sits on the sacred grounds.
2384:[Demon]With a demon by your side, trickery is no problem. Play.
2385:Agree to play.
2386:Seems like a waste of time. Leave.
2387:'Fiend? Who are you calling a fiend, filth?{}{}{}{}I sit here guarding this place, even though I could bugger off and do all sorts, and my own kin throws dirt at me!'
2388:How dare it insult you? Attack!
2389:Nod to acknowledge that it has a point. Ask why it isn't attacking.
2390:Ask why it sits here.
2391:'Why? Should I? Do you intend to loot the pyres or piss on the bones or something? No? Then let's play a game of dice, for I am bored.'
2392:[Intellect]A game of dice is simply a matter of probabilities, and chance is no stranger to your god's domain. Play.
2393:Play.
2394:Yes, you would like to loot. Attack!
2395:Logic and intellect are your weapons, so with every roll you predict the next move.{}{}{}{}But the skeleton doesn't seem to mind this divine intervention.{}{}{}{}You roll many turns until the final roll that will decide the winner.
2396:Despite your sharp mind, chance has its way. You lose and realise too late that some of your belongings are gone. When you turn to face the skeleton, it is nowhere to be found. Leave.
2397:Chance has its way with you for a time, but then you turn the tables and win. The skeleton simply nods, and you feel different after the experience. Leave.
2398:Your game is flawless. You win, and the skeleton looks impressed. It hands you the dice as a reward and adds another gift. Nod in thanks and leave.
2399:The game is a draw. The skeleton nods in thanks for the time well spent, then ignores you. Leave.
2400:Playing against demons is a sure way to lose one's soul, but the skeleton seems beyond such concerns. The game begins.{}{}{}{}You roll many turns until the final roll that will decide the winner.
2401:You cheat your way to victory and the skeleton looks impressed. It hands you the dice as a reward, then leaves. Nod in thanks and leave.
2402:You roll many turns until the final roll that will decide the winner.
2403:Your game is flawless. You win, and the skeleton looks impressed. It hands you the dice as a reward, then leaves. Leave.
2404:'A fellow awakened bone man! Nice to meet you. {}{}{}{}You wanna play a game of dice? I hope you don't mind the garish materials -- my dark sense of humour, I am afraid.'{}{}{}{}He shakes the orc leather cup that holds the bone dice. 
2405:Disgusting. Attack!
2406:Ask why he sits here.
2407:'I woke up in the pyre, alive -- or, well, you know what I mean. So I decided my duty is to sit here and guard this place. I was one of the matriarch daughters and her ashes lie here, so I will guard her.{}{}{}{}But it is boring, so I like to play games.'
2408:How un-orcish. Attack!
2409:'Good, good. Let's have some fun. Roll the dice.'
2410: [Intellect]A game of dice is simply a matter of probabilities, and chance is no stranger to your god's domain. Play.
2411:As you get up to leave, you suddenly realise that more time has passed than you thought, and you see markings on your body that were not there before.{}{}{}{}You wonder what the creature may have done to you. The orc skeleton, however, is gone.
2412:'Pathetic. You call me a bad orc, ha! I shall feed on your spirit but let you leave, weaklings.'
2413:You come to a seemingly unassuming spot where a single crooked tree stands over a tiny pond. {}{}{}{}There is an overwhelming sense of tranquillity the closer you get to the pond, and those sensitive to the weaves of magic know this to be an old place of power.{}{}{}{}If you're a magic user, you can perform some rituals here.
2414:What is a place of power, exactly?
2415:Take the spirit essence of the dwarf and try to release him here.
2416:Ignore the dwarves' fate, leave.
2417:Places of power are spots where an unusual spiritual or magical presence has left a lasting mark. They can come in many forms.
2418:Like what?
2419:They can be places where the connection to the greyworld -- the realm of the spirits -- is strong, or where a spirit decided to dwell and aid the living.{}{}{}{}They can also be places where extreme events occurred, creating emotional imprints, or perhaps great magical deeds that left behind traces. They can be places where great mages resided, letting their magic seep into the very soil.{}{}{}{}The list goes on.
2420:You take the dwarven spirit and place it carefully into the small pond by the tree. You feel that the waters are blessed by an elder spirit and can indeed free the dwarf.{}{}{}{}But, if done improperly, the ritual can cost you your own faith.{}{}{}{}You feel that you could also try to bind the spirit to you instead of freeing it.
2421:Release the spirit.
2422:Bind the spirit.
2423:Binding a spirit against its will is filthy business. You succeed, but you feel your soul weakened by the deed.
2424:Your ritual succeeds, but the spirit proves too strong for binding. You do, however, feel that you've learned a lot from the ritual.
2425:The ritual works, but the forceful binding of an unwilling dwarven spirit is dreadfully dishonourable. {}{}{}{}The dwarves in your party feel the brunt of their shame.
2426:The dwarven spirit is now bound to servitude.
2427:The ritual works and the ancient spirit from the pond unlocks the bonds that held the dwarven soul captive. The freed dwarf pounds his hand on his chest:{}{}{}{}'You kept your word, and I deem you worthy of my services. The graveyard be fine for a time.'
2428:Great. Now leave together.
2429:The ritual works and the ancient spirit from the pond unlocks the bonds that held the dwarven soul captive. The freed dwarf pounds his hand on his chest:{}{}{}{}'You kept your word, and now I must return to my duties. May stone and iron ever be with ya!'
2430:Great. Leave.
2431:You come to a place of power. It is ever present and clear, but alas, you are not the one who carries the ghost essence, so you cannot do anything here.
2432:Your efforts fail, and the ritual drains a lot out of you.{}{}{}{}The dwarves in your party feel the brunt of their shame.
2433:You come to a small shack where you were told the demon that enslaved the dwarf smith dwells.{}{}{}{}As you approach, you feel a concentration of darkness within. 
2434:Ignore the dwarven request and leave.
2435:Inside, the house is abandoned, decaying, and dark -- so dark, in fact, that no manner of light illuminates it.{}{}{}{}A voice croaks: 'I smell nothing of use for me, so leave me be, or I'll devour you just for fun!'
2436:Turmoil and magic can both cut through darkness. Use your domain to see the truth here.
2437:Nature and intellect do not bend easily to trickery, and you sense truth concealed. Try to see through it.
2438:Harmony and light do not fare well under the pressure of darkness. Yet here, you do not feel weakened. Try to see through the deception.
2439:The dark veil drops and behind it sits nothing more than a karakandza demon.  It stares at you in fear:{}{}{}{}'Ehmmm, I was not prepared for fighting. Can we make a deal?'
2440:No deals. Kill it.
2441:What deal?
2442:'I'll give you some of the goods that dwarf smith's been making for me. I'll even throw in a little something extra -goodwill and all that...'{}{}
2443:Agree only if he lets the dwarf free.
2444:Agree to the deal, ignoring the dwarf's fate.
2445:'The deal's sealed.'{}{}{}{}The demon claps its hands and disappears, leaving you the promised goods - and, you hope, nothing more...
2446:'You can either have the dwarf freed or have my goodies, and before you waste your time with death threats, that's all I can offer.'
2447:Deal for the dwarf's freedom.
2448:The creature looks angry, but nods and claps its hands. It then disappears.{}{}{}{}When you go back to the dwarf, the smithy is collapsed in rubble, and all you find is a very old stone skeleton. But, as promised, the skeleton has some good loot waiting for you.
2449:The creature dissolves into green goo as you strike it. It is probably dead.{}{}{}{}When you go back to the dwarf, the smithy is collapsed in rubble, and all you find is a very old stone skeleton. But, as promised, the skeleton has some good loot waiting for you.
2450:Before you can figure it out, you feel the overwhelming presence of true darkness. Whoever was trying to trick you managed to summon the real thing, probably.
2451:Leave!
2452:In the name of Horz, make them bow to you!
2453:As a bloodtracker, show these wolves your raw will and make them heel!
2454:As matriarch, dominate these wolves with your sheer power!
2455:As a night demon, intimidate the beasts. 
2456:An old hooded woman answers the door and gestures for you to enter. {}{}{}{}She then goes back in, sits in her rocking chair, and calls out to you. 'Come in, come in, strangers. May I offer you hot food? Sweets? Or perhaps some trade?'{}{}
2457:You find the ruins long abandoned and looted many times over. Just as you are about to give up, you discover a hidden entrance to an underground chamber, protected by a huge, heavy slab of stone that once may have been a doorway. 
2458:You have some craft tools. Use them to try to pry this entrance open.
2459:As knowledge is your guide, think of a way to use levers and open this thing.
2460:Use your muscle to break through.
2461:With tools in hand, you manage to find the hinges and pry the old stone slab open. {}{}{}{}You see a dark corridor leading deeper down. The air is stale, and the darkness seems to stare back at you.{}{}
2462:Actually, it looks too scary. Just leave.
2463:You find a way to open the slab using brains over brawn.{}{}{}{}You see a dark corridor leading deeper down. The air is stale, and the darkness seems to stare back at you.
2464:The stone slab cracks under the pressure of your brawn, but it crumbles so utterly that you fall into the corridor with the rubble.{}{}{}{}You see a dark corridor leading deeper down. The air is stale, and the darkness seems to stare back at you.
2465:Go in deeper.
2466:The stone breaks under your assault, and the way in is clear.{}{}{}{}You see a dark corridor leading deeper down. The air is stale, and the darkness seems to stare back at you.
2467:You descend down the winding corridor until you reach a chamber with six stone columns. Between them are alcoves with granite chests and vases.
2468:Search the chamber.
2469:You spot the silhouettes of humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling by the columns. {}{}{}{}They have spotted you as well...
2470:Use your knowledge of demon lore to identify these creatures.
2471:Focus on your divine domain to figure this out.
2472:These creatures are clearly some of your demon kin. Consider how to resolve the situation.
2473:As you walk into the chamber, you are ambushed by creatures that fall from the ceiling upon you!
2474:Run, even though you may take some damage.
2475:Striga are unliving fiends known not only to drink the blood of the living but also to devour their entrails! {}{}
2476:Attack them with the aid of light or harmony!
2477:[Bloodless creatures]Since the strigas are after blood, bloodless creatures should be able to sneak in and out without trouble.
2478:You sense that these creatures are of the night, tainted by darkness. As such, you can call upon your domain to give you strength to fight them.
2479:The striga are cursed souls who need to feed on the blood of the living to survive. They were clearly locked in here for a long time and are now starving. {}{}{}{}If you give them blood, they will let you loot in peace.  
2480:Give them some of your blood. 
2481:You speak to your kin and give them some of your blood. {}{}{}{}The strigas honour the deal. You can loot in peace. 
2482:Great. Gather the loot and leave.
2483:You speak to your kin and give them some of your blood, but this act is unnatural and conflicts with one of your divine domains. {}{}{}{}You feel weakened in spirit, but the striga honour the deal. You can loot in peace.{}{}
2484:The striga are dead and the chamber yours to pilfer. 
2485:No matter how much you try, the old stone slab will not move.
2486:You carefully sneak in. The strigas stir, their red eyes following you, but they do not attack. 
2487:The strigas tear your flesh and feast on your blood even as you run for your lives. {}{}
2488:It may go against the laws of nature's domain, but bind the skeletons to your service!
2489:These unliving abominations mock the laws of nature. You should oppose them.
2490:The domains of nature and harmony stand against enslaving the dead to one's will. {}{}{}{}Your ritual dissolves and the bones collapse at peace. You feel a sickness upon you.{}{}
2491:The ritual works and you gain the servitude of an unliving fiend.{}{}
2492:The ritual does not work and you barely escape from the unliving.{}{}
2493:'You, you friend. Friend go, we not tear flesh.'{}{}{}{}The unliving turn and walk away. One of them leaves its weapons for you and you see a glimmer of awakening in its eyes...
2494:'You, you friend. Friend go, we not tear flesh.'{}{} {}{}The skeletons move away, but one stays behind:{}{}'You, you serve no more. Me, me serve you.'{}{}{}{}This may not be the awakening you hoped for, but it's a first step. The skeleton now serves you.
2495:The skeletons continue towards you mindlessly and some arrows fly your way. {}{}
2496:The skeletons beat you badly and you barely escape.{}{}
2497:Despite its first appearance, this seems to be an old dwarven burial ground -- an unusual find. You spot a rugged group of grave robbers who got here before you!
2498:[Magic user] Try performing a ritual to calm the spirits.
2499:The angered wraiths leave you depleted, but they do not follow you as you flee.
2500:You defeat the wraiths and your spirit is lifted by the deed.
2501:The qizicons are an old goblin tradition dating back to the old country -- a fabled place of your kind's origin. A trinket master, or shaman as you now call them, will leave such an object as a sign of their legacy. This one doesn't look too complicated, but it may be booby-trapped.
2502:[Orc] Place the body on a pyre and call out to the warrior's soul to face its last battle in honour. Take the stash of goods after, the dead do not need it.
2503:[Shaman] Appease the spirit of the fallen, before taking their loot.
2504:You're ambushed by a scruffy scavenger:{}{}{}{}'Oi, you, this is mine, die!'
2505:Defend yourself!
2506:You defeat your enemy and search the rest of this site in peace.
2507:You're ambushed by a bog bies that has its lair here!{}{}
2508:The creatures beat you badly and you barely escape. Worse yet, this place was clearly toxic as you feel ill afterwards.
2509:You're ambushed by a bog bies that has its lair here and worse yet, it attacks you with its spirit!{}{}
2510:You're ambushed by a lone befuddler, who seems very out of place here, yet angry and clearly determined to take it out on you!{}{}
2511:Try to reason with him!
2512:'Oh, I am sorry. I was just... lost. Your beautiful visage snapped me out of this wretched trance. Thank you for calming me down. I must go search for my pond now. Here, a gift for your kind deed.'
2513:Thank him and leave.
2514:[Dwarf] Cover the bones in stone so they may return to the earth.
2515:'Yanek, Yanek! Come over here lad!'{}{}You hear your grandma's voice coming from the house: {}{}'Bring me a jar of pickles dear, they're in the cellar. Just watch out for them pesky rats, they get pretty big this time of year'. {}{}{}{}You grab your sword, though a mouse trap would probably be more appropriate.{}{}{}{}
2516:Tell your nan you'll go straight away. Head to the cellar, prepared to face the rats.
2517:Just as nan warned you, there are rats here. You hesitate and hear the trusted voice of your friend, Theodore:{}{}{}{}'You are about to start a challenge lad. What is a challenge, you'll ask me? Well, a challenge is a way of resolving conflicts or problems in this world. Sometimes it will be a conflict between your group and an enemy group, other times it will be an attempt to solve a puzzle or simply a test of strength. Challenges take the form of a card game. As the gods themselves were playing with our fate, you see.'{}{}
2518:A card game? Like a regular blackjack?
2519:You're not going to give up that easily, are you?
2520:Try again.
2521:Run away to Main Menu.
2522:The rats are dead and the pickles are yours at last. Proud of yourself, you bring the jar back to grandma.{}{}{}{}'Your ankle is bleeding Yanek, are you okay?'- she asks.{}{}You shrug and assure her you're good. Grandma gives you that patronising, nan look: {}{}{}{}'Better take a suit of armour next time dear, one day you'll scratch your legs off! Anyway, be a dearie and go check what attracts those nasty critters to our cellar, eh? If grandpa's spilled some pear compote again...'{}{}
2523:Go back to the cellar.
2524:You open the cellar door again, prepared to clean the rat corpses away and be done with it, when you sense movement. In a  dark corner, you notice a familiar shape, although much bigger than usual. A pine cone? You look closer and notice that a set of beady yellow eyes is looking you up and down and a row of sharp teeth glares at you in a smile.
2525:Could this be  a pineconette?
2526:You faintly recall some stories you've heard about woodland spirits looking like pine cones. They are sure to know a bit of magic but rarely bother humans outside of the forest. What is this one doing here you can't tell, but it's your grandma's cellar after all, and no pinecone will munch on her winter supplies! {}{}As you march confidently to kick the creature out, sword drawn, its eyes start glowing and a high-pitched shout hurts your ears. You tighten the grip on your sword only to notice that it crumbles away to dust. {}{}What trickery is this? - you ask yourself, but no answer follows and the pineconette attacks you with its magic.{}{}
2527:Ok, this wasn't supposed to happen. Have you cheated? The whole purpose of this tutorial was to teach you how to run away. What are you doing in the tutorial area anyway, eh? Go smash some orc skulls and stop pretending you don't know how to play.
2528:Leave...
2529:You black out, but Theodores' voice wakes you:{}{}{}{}'Well, you were asking for it, you know? Fighting a spiritual challenge without a specialist? Facing a much stronger enemy is rarely a good idea. When odds are stacked against you, running away or surrendering could be the best option. Sure, you might get a bruise or lose some morale, but it's still better than outright losing. Remember that lesson for the future!'{}{}
2530:Aww, my head...
2531:You snap out of the half-hypnotic state the pineconette has put you in and manage to rush out of the cellar and lock the door behind you. You run to your nan and scream a pineconette is attacking your house. Grandma raises her brow at you: {}{}{}{}'Is? You mean you left it there? By Svarog's might... In my days we stoked fires with cones, you youngsters are so timid. Fine, I'll deal with it myself. After dinner that is. I suppose you were a smart lad to escape instead of getting your bottom whacked.'
2532:End
2533:'Nothing of that sort, lad. The cards you play  represent *you*, with all your strengths, weaknesses and abilities. That sword you've got there - you can use it against the rats and you will gain skill in the card game because of it.'
2534:Phew, you thought for a minute there you could get hurt from this challenge business?
2535:'Sure you can, lad! The wounds you get during a challenge are as real as that jar of pickles you're about to fetch. If you're not careful, you'll have to spend the next week at the healer's hut, or your mind or spirit may suffer. Better be careful!{}{}{}{}If you see this symbol: <sprite name=ChallengePhysical> - it means that answer leads to a challenge. The number next to it, between 1 and 10,  indicates difficulty.'{}{}{}{}You're never quite sure how and when Theo comes and goes, but here you are - standing in front of grandma's cellar, ready for anything.
2536:Open the door and fight your way to the jar of pickles.
2537:Head back, you've got more important things to do. [EXIT TO MAIN MENU]
2538:'Thank you, brave adventurers!' - grandma tries her best to say it in as deep and smooth voice as she can, but still sounds more like the big bad wolf: 'The princess is safe. Here is your map to the treasure.'{}{}{}{}You squeak with joy and jump up vigorously, almost knocking over granny's rocking chair. When you finally settle down, she continues:{}{}{}{}'When the heroes look closer at the map, they realise, that it's all mixed up. They will have to solve the puzzle to get to the treasure.'{}{}{}{}She gives you one of her serious looks:{}{}{}{} 'But it's only a story, right? Now off to bed you two!' {}{}
2539:Wait for nan to leave and look at the map.
2540:You hear Theodore's voice again:{}{}{}{}'Challenges can also be used to test your group's intellectual abilities. But unlike when you faced the rats, this time, you will be challenged by a concept.{}{}{}{}"Concepts" is a general term and covers all situations where you do not fight against characters. Climbing a cliff, spotting danger, solving a puzzle or performing a ritual are all examples of a challenge versus concept.{}{}{}{}Concepts are represented by cards just as characters are, but in all concept challenges only the natural abilities of your characters count. Any equipment they have is disregarded. Other rules remain the same.{}{}{}{}Each time you see a symbol with cards black inside like this - <sprite name="MentalConceptChallengeIcon"> - it means it is a challenge against a concept.'{}{}
2541:Okay, begin the mental challenge.
2542:You hear nan laugh behind you: {}{}{}{}'Well done my little adventurers! There, in the middle of a meadow, you see a table, full of goodies!" {}{}{}{}And having said that, granny produces a bowl of fruit and beetle jelly - your favourites.{}{}{}{}'Now, this time, off to bed, for real!'{}{}{}{}But, as usual, there's only one answer one can expect...
2543:Noooo... one more story! Pleeeease!
2544:Nan sighs. Knowing that it's late and seeing how hard you tried, she gives you some clues and you feel smarter. She asks:  {}{}{}{}'I know I said bedtime before, but do you want to try again?'
2545:Yes.
2546:No.
2547:Fall asleep. [EXIT TO MENU]
2548:'Okay, it's getting late, time for bed.' - says grandma and closes her book: {}{}{}{}'Make sure you wash your feet!'{}{}{}{}But, as usual, there's only one answer one can expect...
2549:Nan takes a deep breath, she looks tired herself but determined to keep her authority:{}{}{}{}'Now you listen to me rascals, if you want to hear another story, it will be tomorrow. You want night demons or wolves to come snatch you up for being naughty?'{}{}{}{}You look at each other. The threat of the night mares, or worse, chills your bones, but winning with nan would be so exciting.{}{}
2550:Story! Story! Story!
2551:You really thought you had her, but then she pulls the old nan card, leans back in her chair, and closes her eyes and snores. {}{}Quietly, you slide the book from her hands, hoping to find another story.{}{}As the moon shines through your window, you hear wolves howling in the distance and the wind rustling in the yard...{}{}
2552:The End.
2553:That nan is no joker. She crosses her arms and raises her brow at you and you know the fun is over. You rush to bed obediently. {}{}{}{}As the moon shines through your window, you hear wolves howling in the distance and the wind rustling in the yard...{}{}
2554:Drunk and jolly you make your way home from a good game of dice. A heavy purse jingles at your belt. The sun is setting but the air is still warm, so the long walk home doesn't bother you. {}{} {}{}The path leads through a small woodland and as you were about to take the last turn towards home, some ruffians jump out from behind a bush:{}{}{}{}'Your money or your lives!' - shouts the smallest of them with a squeaky voice.{}{}
2555:Your dwarven pride is slightly wounded at this brazen display of ignorance. Tell them to beat it before they spoil your good day. 
2556:They look at each other and then back at your sack of coins. {}{}{}{}'We ain't scared of your kind, we'll take ya!'{}{}{}{}They are either brave, stupid or desperate.
2557:You beat their silly arses to a pulp and make them run:{}{}{}{}'Sorry, sorry master dwarf, we'll go now!' {}{}{}{}You return home, and hopefully, confident enough to face any challenge Thea may throw you.{}{}{}{}
2558:Congratulations!{}{}{}{}You have completed our tutorial and learnt the basics of our card game mechanics. Remember, you can always replay this if you need to refresh any information.{}{} {}{}Now go face the real Thea, if you dare!{}{}{}{}{}{}
2559:End tutorial and return to the Main Menu
2560:Ouch, dwarf or no dwarf, they beat you badly!{}{}{}{}For now, you have been healed.{}{}{}{}Would you like a rematch?
2561:No, they beat me, but I get the rules now.
2562:Two of you enjoy some time together, perhaps you are friends perhaps more. {}{}{}{}But the ever-vigilant and slightly over enthusiastic stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to you soon after.{}{} 
2563:Rejoice.
2564:The nights are long and lonely, some of you find comfort in each other's company.{}{}{}{} {}{}But the ever-vigilant and slightly over enthusiastic stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to you soon after.{}{}
2565:The nights are long and lonely, some of you find comfort in each other's company.{}{}{}{}But the ever-vigilant and slightly over enthusiastic stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to you soon after.{}{}
2566:Elves are notoriously elitist in their choice of mates but it seems a person of beauty has caught one's eye. {}{}{}{}Elven children are born out of a mystical bond, and it seems two of your own folk have enjoyed such a connection. {}{}{}{}The effects of such a union can vary, but a child soon arrives.
2567:Dwarven fascination with h the unique beauty of rusalkas has long been a fact. And well, your own dwarf and water demonette decided to explore those long-time traditions.{}{}{}{}A stork heralds a child from the union, but who this child will be is a mystery.
2568:Contrary to all known lore and dwarven custom, a dwarf child, grown beyond the rock infancy, comes along and you know it is yours.
2569:Take them in.
2570:Rusalkas are known to lure males and thus procreate, yet it is so very rare to happen with non-humans. Still, the fates bless you and a young rusalka, you daughter, appears from the lake.
2571:Take her in.
2572:Rusalkas are known to lure males and thus procreate, yet it is so very rare to happen with non-humans. Still, the fates bless you and a young befuddler, your son and a male spawn of the rusalka comes out of the lake.
2573:Take him in.
2574:Rusalkas are known to lure males and thus procreate, yet it is so very rare to happen with non-humans. {}{}{}{}Oddly enough, a human looking child is born to the rusalka, but one that carries traits from both their parents.
2575:A couple of your folk found themselves a child in the cabbage patch!{}{}
2576:Despite the rough differences in culture, love knows no bounds and under the watchful eye of Lada some feisty lovemaking breaks the monotony of life.{}{}{}{}A stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to the happy couple soon after. 
2577:Despite the rough differences in culture, love knows no bound and under the watchful eye of Lada some feisty lovemaking breaks the monotony of life.{}{}{}{}A stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to the happy couple soon after. 
2578:The nights are long and lonely, some of you find comfort in each other's arms.{}{}{}{}A stork is spotted nearby and as sure as death, a child is brought to the happy couple soon after. 
2579:Either love knows no bounds, or there is something wrong with the stork, but... {}{}{}{}Your unliving friend got really friendly with someone, and the stork decided to deliver an offspring into their care.{}{}{}{} 
2580:Dwarven mating is a thing of secrecy, and since you have chosen a path outside of your kin, you have no memory of how it works.{}{}{}{}However, you have proven friend to the Earthbound, and so the two of you are invited to partake in the life-giving ritual that may provide you with a child. {}{} 
2581:Take part in the ritual.
2582:You enter deep into the old dwarven tunnels. The male has to follow his instinct and find the life-rock. His mate awaits. Once the rock is brought back, the female sings the life song, and together they carve the stone in hopes of it becoming a child. {}{}{}{}Only one such ceremony can be undertaken every two decades and it is not always successful.{}{} 
2583:Await the results. 
2584:Despite being away from your kin, your instincts proved strong. Your life-rock flourishes into a child.
2585:You have been away from your kind too long and your life-song could not awaken a dwarven soul. Instead, a young rocker comes to life. {}{} 
2586:A couple of your folk found  a child in the cabbage patch!{}{}
2587:Your wounds were too grave and so the gates to the underwolds open to take your soul.
2588:Depart.
2589:'YOU ARE MY CHOSEN HOW DARE YOU DIE!'{}{}{}{}The lady of death clutches a corpse and thrusts your soul into it, commanding you to go on.
2590:You allowed your chosen to die! Without the divine bond, you will no longer have any power or influence over the world, thus your reign will end.{}{}{}{}Thankfully, you have one more chance to remain in the game. Call upon the spirit of the Cosmic Tree itself and ask for the soul of your chosen to be returned to you. {}{}{}{}Remember, the price is high and it will get higher every time you abuse your divine power like this. 
2591:Pay with two lives to return the one.
2592:Pay with four lives to return the one.
2593:Pay with six lives to return the one.
2594:Pay with eight lives to return the one.
2595:Pay with ten lives to return the one.
2596:Pay with fifteen lives to return the one.
2597:Pay with twenty lives to return the one.
2598:You cannot or will not pay. It is time to end this journey.
2599:Use the divine power of the cosmic seed to return your chosen!
2600:You paid your bloody dues and the spirit of your chosen is returned, now pray that it comes back in the right flesh...
2601:Await your chosen.
2602:Damn the gods and their divine games! The strain of this dark world is too much and so you have abandoned you duties in search for a more peaceful life. 
2603:You stand by the water and sense you are not alone. 
2604:You hear a beautiful flute melody and see three women wearing sparse white garments whirling around in a circle.{}{}{}{}Their energy and laughter are infectious, and they beckon you to come join them.
2605:[Rusalka]Dance with your sisters.
2606:[Befuddler]Stand aside and try to join in.
2607:[Vodnik] Join the rusalkas - after all, they are your subjects.
2608:[Demon]Stay alert for trickery, but join in.
2609:[Intellect or Nature] Intellect and nature dictate that this may be a trap. Remain cautious but join them.
2610:The melody is so sublime, the dancers so exquisite -- go, dance, forget your worries.
2611:You join in and twist and twirl till your head spins with stars. Your sisters welcome you:{}{}{}{}'We feel you are changed, yet not fully estranged, your new path is dry, for this we cry, but we will dance with no backward glance.'
2612:Dance away like you did in your youth, and accept any blessings or trickery that may come of it.
2613:You don't need the competition. Attack!
2614:You come closer and clap your hands in rhythm, remembering your childhood games. The rusalkas finally see you and sing:{}{}{}{}'A child of ours, a child so wrong, neither pretty nor strong, yet somehow do you belong?'{}{}{}{}You know the dance can give powerful gifts, but for you, it can also bring pain.{}{}
2615:Focus on remembering the right dance.
2616:Answer that you are no longer judged by their harsh ways. The gods give you strength now.
2617:This brings back childhood trauma. Attack!
2618:The rusalkas accept you into their circle and you feel their blessings, but then they turn on you and sing: {}{}{}{}'A child of ours once you were, but now another's mark you bear. Begone, wretched fruit of our loins!'{}{}{}{}You feel your spirits drain as your kin once more rejects you, but you have also learned a harsh lesson not to trust them again.
2619:The rusalkas turn nasty and sing:{}{}{}{}'A child of ours once you were, but now another's mark you bear. Begone, wretched fruit of our loins!'{}{}{}{}You feel your spirits drain and your body weaken as your kin once more rejects you.
2620:'A sister's pity left your ugly heart beating, but your twisted face is a disgrace. Begone!'
2621:'A sister's pity left your ugly heart beating, so let's dance this moment, however fleeting.'{}{}{}{}The rusalkas allow you to join them in the dance, and you feel a blessing from it. 
2622:You try to join, but the rusalkas stop and glare at you.{}{}{}{}'A water master you may be, a lord of lake and even sea, but here we are creatures free, so please, do flee.'
2623:[Vodnik]They will not speak to you this way. Intimidate your underlings.
2624:[Vodnik]It is good to see such free spirits. And that one rusalka, so pretty. Tell her you are in awe of her beauty.
2625:This is unacceptable. Attack!
2626:The rusalkas turn nasty and sing:{}{}{}{}'A master indeed is what we need? We only ever needed your wet seed and now we'll watch you bleed!'{}{}
2627:'Your words are nice, yet your manhood remains a vice. Out of our breeding time, it will not entice. Be well.'
2628:The rusalkas accept you into their circle, and the one you flattered takes you aside into the waters, whispering,{}{}{}{}'It is not yet my time to mate, but your mastery may this rule negate.'{}{}
2629:Flattery gets you everywhere, it seems, as the rusalka joins your path. Leave together.
2630:It seems your meddling with human gods has changed you, and from this union the rusalka brings you an unwanted befuddler child. Leave.
2631:The rusalkas accept you into their circle and you feel its blessings, but then they turn on you and sing: {}{}{}{}'A master indeed is what we need? We only ever needed your wet seed and now we'll watch you bleed!'{}{}{}{}These trickster ladies let you win so you'll land in their embrace. You feel your spirit drained.
2632:You approach the women and the melody becomes more seductive with every step. {}{}{}{}Luckily, you were prepared for such trickery, so the charm has no real hold over you -- for now.{}{}{}{}You are aware that if you last through a whole dance, you could be rewarded.
2633:Keep your wits about you and dance with the rusalkas. 
2634:[Magic user or Mysticism] Use magic to ward you from this charm, then dance with the rusalkas.
2635:Too great a risk. Just leave.
2636:Were you fighting just now?{}{}{}{}The melody is so sweet, the air smells of lilies and fresh water, and the nymphs move like flower petals on the lake...{}{}{}{}You dance and dance and dance until your very spirit is drained...
2637:Dancing is great...
2638:The pretty ladies dance so nicely, and the melody is so sweet. But as you dance and dance, you feel something is wrong. Before the demons can siphon your life force, you break free. {}{}{}{}The demonettes are gone, and you even feel you gained something here.
2639:The melody is so sweet, the air smells of lilies and fresh water, and the nymphs move like flower petals on the lake...{}{}{}{}You dance and dance and dance until your very spirit is drained...
2640:The rusalkas accept you into their circle and you feel its blessings, but then they turn on you and sing: {}{}{}{}'A child of ours once you were, you may now be other, but we do not care as you dance with the water's flair!'{}{}
2641:The rusalkas accept you into their circle and you feel empowered by their dance. {}{}{}{}Afterwards they bow to you and apologise for their rudeness. They honour you as the king of the waters. {}{}
2642:One of the rusalkas yields to your dominance and decides to follow your lead. Leave together.
2643:The demons' trickery fails, and you see the real faces of the dancing nymphs. {}{}{}{}They run off, angry, and you feel wiser for surviving this encounter.
2644:You find a small, secluded pond surrounded by high grass and weeping willows bowing their sorrowful heads into the silvery surface.{}{}{}{}There is a figure sitting on the shore, hunched and clearly deep in thought and concern.
2645:[Water demon]Ask if this pond belongs to the vodnik.
2646:Approach the man.
2647:The man seems suspicious. Attack him!
2648:The man turns to you, and you see he is a vodnik, with green hair and fishy eyes. He looks at you with sadness:{}{}{}{}'Mine? Yes, yes. But the bear, the bear is all wrong, I don't know what to do...'
2649:Ask if he means the Plough. And why would he say the stars are broken?
2650:Offer to help in exchange for a demon deal -- a favour he will be bound to.
2651:The vodnik points to the surface of the pond and you see the reflection of the Plough, but it is missing one star. {}{}{}{}'The star is hiding from me. It won't come. I don't know what to do!'
2652:[Light]Offer to call upon the light domain to gain the star's attention.
2653:This seems to be pointless. Leave.
2654:In the name of Zorya, the stars do as they will. Tell the demon to stop fretting.
2655:Ask him to explain where exactly the problem lies.
2656:Agree to help with this 'problem.' But ask what you can do.
2657:[Vodnik]He simply needs to do the star dance properly so the bear star is called and the beast kept at bay. Tell him there is no need to fret and that you are willing to aid him.
2658:'No, no, you don't understand. All the bear's stars must touch the surface of the pond, else a beast will rise from beyond!' 
2659:[Turmoil]As turmoil demands it, face this beast!
2660:[Zorya or Light]Say you will demand that the star show itself to the vodnik.
2661:By the will of Zorya, wait for the beast to come!
2662:Agree to face the beast that comes.
2663:You wait, ready for battle, and indeed, soon the waters stir and a beast lunges at you!
2664:Actually, retreat...
2665:You call upon the light in the night sky and the missing star responds. Its gentle yet sharp gaze touches the pond, and the vodnik claps three times with joy. With each clap he leaves a reward for your efforts before he disappears into the waters. 
2666:You fail, and the vodnik cries and claps six times:{}{}{}{}'Now I must make a sacrifice to keep the beast at bay. Stupid, stupid star. Begone, you!'{}{}{}{}He disappears into the waters. 
2667:Damn it. 
2668:'Well, you could try calling the star, I suppose. I couldn't do it on my own. {}{}{}{}We need to hold hands and hop from one star to the other on one leg, with one eye covered, while singing to the stars. Will you do it?'
2669:Hop on the stars?
2670:Agree and accept the physical challenge.
2671:Decline and leave him be.
2672:'Yes, the stars, on the water, obviously. Worry not, for if you hold my hand, you will not fall into the abyss of the pond. But if you should falter in any way...'
2673:'Of course, with your help we can do it!'{}{}{}{}You take each other's hands and hop on one leg while closing your right eye and singing to the stars. {}{}{}{}The starlight returns and you feel its blessings upon you.
2674:Great! Say your goodbyes and leave.
2675:'Oh, you devious thing. Upon the bear star, I agree, and if I lie it will be the end of me. Happy? Now how will you help?'
2676:Offer to call upon the light domain to gain the star's attention.
2677:'What? Why is it a problem?'
2678:'Ah, visitors... pray come here and help, for I have a conundrum to solve, and the matter is grave indeed.'{}{}{}{}You feel you cannot possibly refuse...
2679:'I feel your unnatural pull on my willpower. Speak now or no help will come to you!'
2680:Try to resist this strange pull.
2681:'Bah, you are strong in spirit, and I have no time for games. Alas, the bear up in the sky -- one of its paws is missing!' 
2682:Despite the vodnik's silver tongue and magic weaves, you are not fooled. The creature cries out in disappointment and disappears in the waters, but you feel an ominous presence as you too leave the area.
2683:You failed, and you felt compelled to come to the vodnik's aid. First he made you jump and dance, then swim in the pond with no clothes, then sing and clap hands with him, and then he finally left you alone, but you feel utterly drained. {}{}{}{}The vodnik seems pleased as he disappears. 'Yes, yes, tragedy averted, thanks.'
2684:You take hold of the vodnik and, for a time, as your bodies lift from the ground, you think he really will take you to the stars. Instead, the strange dance takes place on the pond, where you hop from one star-reflection to the other. {}{}{}{}'Yes, yes, we're doing it!'
2685:Keep your concentration.
2686:When you reach the last star-reflection, you look up and see a beautiful rising light shine very brightly on the vodnik. {}{}{}{}The demon smiles and bows first to the star, then to you. {}{}{}{}'Thank you, I must go now and be with my star, but here, your reward!'
2687:You take hold of the vodnik and, for a time, as your bodies lift from the ground, you think he really will take you to the stars. Instead, the strange dance takes place on the pond, where you hop from one star-reflection to the other. {}{}{}{}Alas, it is not as easy as it looks, and you are unable to keep up with the demon.
2688:Try to stop and get back to shore.
2689:'It is good you know your weakness, for if you fell or stayed behind, it would be hard for me to help you. Now, leave, please, I must try to finish in peace.'{}{}{}{}He takes you back to the shore and, other than feeling exhausted, you're fine.
2690:You take hold of the vodnik and, for a time, as your bodies lift from the ground, you think he really will take you to the stars. Instead, the strange dance takes place on the pond, where you hop from one star-reflection to the other.{}{}{}{}Alas, it is not as easy as it looks. You lose your balance and fall behind. The vodnik moves away, and it feels like you are falling!
2691:Try to hold on.
2692:The pond swallows you in its black belly, and for a time you think you may be done for. You see a menacing pair of red eyes staring at you from the depths.{}{}{}{}Then a light pulls you out and throws you to the shore.{}{}{}{}The vodnik is nowhere to be seen, but you do see an extra star in the sky.
2693:You come close to the shore of a body of water and spot a group of humanoid creatures with fins, beady eyes, and scales. {}{}{}{}They are huddling over a shipwreck and you see human bodies at their feet.
2694:[Utopiec]Greet your kin.
2695:[Wisdom or demon]Try to identify these creatures. 
2696:'Friend... you speak the mortal speak... hard it is, unpleasant to the inside hearing.{}{}{}{}Our battle stopped now, we take what is ours. You take not, you are no more water lords.'
2697:Confirm that you walk the path of mortal gods now because they serve you all. Convince them of your sincerity.
2698:Kin or not, the loot is yours. Attack!
2699:'No, be off!'
2700:These are clearly utopiec demons, lesser water fiends who often serve vodniks and rusalkas. They are very capricious.{}{}{}{}Like many demons, they often use games and riddles to play with their potential prey, and this can be used against them.{}{}
2701:Offer to play a game with the utopiec for the loot.
2702:You win the game! Bound by demon laws, the utopiec leave you the wreckage, but as capricious as they are, they sink it and send small water creatures to bite you as you retrieve the stuff.
2703:You lose the game. According to demon laws, the utopiec should take their wreckage, but because they are capricious, they do not.{}{}{}{}'The game good, you play good, you take floating flesh and its stuff.'
2704:You lose the game. Bound by demon laws, the utopiec take their wreckage and also leave you with a nasty rash from gods know where.{}{}
2705:'Weak mortals, silly, why so much anger? Good fighting, me thinks... Bye bye.'{}{}{}{}The utopiec beat you, and as they stand triumphant, they not only leave you be, but also leave you some of the loot from the wreckage. 
2706:'You say truth to us, this is good. Maybe your gods do mean well, as say you. {}{}{}{}Here, we share our loot. Peace with you.'
2707:Thank them and gather your share.
2708:'You no friend no more, you traitor scum.'{}{}{}{}The utopiec spit at you and depart.
2709:You win the game! Bound by demon laws, the utopiec leave you the wreckage.
2710:You come across a small watering hole. There's nothing particularly special about it, but you see a small grey fish flopping about on the shore, dying. 
2711:[Perception] There is something fishy here. Take a closer look. 
2712:[Demon]You sense the presence of your kin. Take a closer look.
2713:Take the fish to eat it.
2714:Poor thing. Throw the fish back into the water. 
2715:Ignore it. Leave.
2716:Some of the fish's grey scales have a faint glimmer of gold on them, and it looks like it's trying to whisper to you.
2717:Must be a goldfish. Folk tales say throwing it back into the water may grant you wishes. Pick it up.
2718:True to your senses, you recognise that this is a minor luck demon, commonly known to mortals as a goldfish. {}{}{}{}You know the best way to get a good deal is to negotiate before helping it, but it appears to be in very bad shape.
2719:Before throwing it into the water, negotiate terms!
2720:You pick up the goldfish, and it speaks to you:{}{}'I... am... dying... throw me into the water, please...'
2721:Demand your three wishes first.
2722:You throw the fish back into the water, and within moments, it wriggles back to life. Its grey scales now flicker with a golden shimmer, and its tail extends with a flourish.{}{}{}{}'You saved me! Thank you. I am afraid I cannot offer my usual wishes, as you did not negotiate before the rescue -- mean, I know, but what can you do? Rules are rules.'
2723:Ask if another reward is in order.
2724:Say it was your pleasure to help out and you require no reward.
2725:No wishes? Demand that you are owed some.
2726:'I cannot say, as this is another rule I am bound by. But see these three water lilies. Choose one, and the reward will await you. Now be well, friends!'
2727:Choose one.
2728:'I am... too... weak...'
2729:Stand firm - no wishes, no water.
2730:'Oh, fine! I agree. Three minor wishes I will grant to thee!'
2731:Why minor?
2732:Some resources.
2733:Weapons.
2734:A resource, a weapon, and a surprise.
2735:Riches, wisdom, and strength.
2736:Demand her demonic protection, for you know your kin must obey such bonds!
2737:'I am a fish! What do you think I could do? World peace? Kingdoms? Why the fuck would I sit here in a pond if I could do that? Hurry, my arse is dry!{}{}{}{}And nothing too fancy, else I will bite you.'
2738:Screw simple - demand the power of the gods!
2739:'Ah, shite, there's always one who will go there. As you wish...{}{}{}{}Here's the formula I'm supposed to say:{}{}Gods ascend through understanding and the will to become. Thus, by making the wish, you have proven yourself forever unworthy.{}{}{}{}And here's one from me: those pompous bastards dislike mortals trying back doors, so any fool who tries gets cursed. I did warn you!' 
2740:Damn it...
2741:'A bargain was made, and thus my oaths are honoured. {}{}{}{}I don't do returns or accept complaints. What you have is it. Bye.'{}{}
2742:You eat the fish. It is small and bony but surprisingly tasty.
2743:'Hmm, odd mortal. Have it your way, sucker.'{}{}{}{}The fish disappears.
2744:'Nope, no wishes for you. Hurry, time's ticking, you only have a choice of two rewards now. 
2745:You enter an old woodland and feel the presence of more than just wildlife here. 
2746:As you go deeper into the forest, you see it is damaged, and you hear the cries of creatures all around. 
2747:[Nature] Nature is your domain, be it by gods or skill. Listen to the forest and hear its woes.
2748:Carefully investigate.
2749:You see the forest has undergone a dramatic change of some sort. There are rocks sticking out of the ground, abruptly broken trees, holes and gaps, and areas of swamp that were not here before, judging from the plant types. {}{}{}{}In one of the swamp patches, you notice a half-submerged tree that you identify as a leshy, an ancient guardian of the forests.
2750:[Leshy]Ask your brother what is amiss here.
2751:Ask the forest guardian how you can help.
2752:Ask him how a leshy got stuck in a swamp?
2753:Leshy wood is good wood. Kill it!
2754:This is pointless. Pick up any valuable wood and leave.
2755:'Treefolk, oof soorts, yoou areee, yeees... Hmmm...{}{}{}{}Maadness, yoou aask? It aalll begaan...'{}{}{}{}
2756:Stop him before he goes on, and remind the leshy that he is almost sunk into the swamp.
2757:'Haaste, indeeed, hoow saad. Pleease, doo help... {}{}{}{}And if yoou cannot help mee, aat leaast chaase the fiend whoo did this to my poor foorest. {}{}{}{}He went thaat waaay!'
2758:You are strong enough to pull the leshy out, so do it.
2759:Try to pull the leshy out by force.
2760:Tell the leshy you are not strong enough to pull him out, but you will seek revenge. Run after whoever did this.
2761:You pull the leshy out of the swamp.{}{}{}{}'Thaank yoou, frieend. I am weak noow and will sleeep. The birds will tell you what happened heere if you wish. If noot, faare thee well, aand have the bodies of my fallen forest as reward.'
2762:Stay to listen to the tale.
2763:Accept the gifts with thanks and leave.
2764:You track down a lone figure, clad in long robes and carrying a heavy staff. {}{}{}{}The figure sits on a stone and does not seem to notice you.
2765:Sneak up and kill them!
2766:Ask them why they destroyed the forest.
2767:[Mysticism]Sense what magic they wield, for it is obvious that they wield some.
2768:Alas, you fail to track the culprit.
2769:Damn it. leave.
2770:The leshy's entrapment stopped him from unleashing his full fury, but as you try to collect the wood, you are assailed by birds, squirrels, and even acorns. {}{}{}{}If there were any valuable wood here, it seems to have disappeared under a blanket of moving shrubbery.
2771:'Hmmm...{}{}{}{}Maadness, you aask, it aall begaan... loong ago, likely befoore your birth froom the looks of your fresh skinn...'{}{}
2772:'Ooh, yoou choose tooo speak the mortaal taalk, hoow ooodd. {}{}{}{}Hmmm... Maadness, you aask, it aall beguun...'{}{}
2773:Apologise for the undue haste, but ask if you can aid the leshy, as it looks like he doesn't have much time left.
2774:The forest is odd. It has rocks, holes, and random patches of swampy areas. {}{}{}{}In one such area, you spot a large, living tree half submerged in mud, struggling to get free but sinking deeper.
2775:Try to pick up any valuable wood and leave.
2776:The leshy falls into slumber. His face disappears in the tree bark, and soon he looks like an old, ordinary oak tree. {}{}{}{}But the birds begin to sing, and you can make out some of the words...
2777:'A figure, a monster, a man, a beast... came, flew, wondered, arrived!{}{}{}{}Foul smell, noises, ground shaking, skies falling!{}{}{}{}Dead, dead birds, dead plants, death and change!'{}{}{}{}These words are repeated in various orders. The birds also seem to point in a direction.
2778:No need to get involved with whoever could cause this much change. Leave.
2779:Follow the direction.
2780:You feel the presence of pure turmoil and heavy darkness within this person. 
2781:Sneak up and kill them.
2782:Perform a ritual of light to destroy the darkness!
2783:[Shadow elf]Speak to your brethren. Offer a cleansing ritual that will soothe and give greater control over the turmoil within. 
2784:[Shadow elf]Say that you too were tormented once, but upon joining the path of the cosmic tree, you found balance. Tell them it is possible.
2785:[Elf]Shadowkin, cursed by darkness long ago, unable to return to light. Offer them your own spirit force to help them achieve balance of light and turmoil, as you achieved when you joined the cosmic path of the gods.
2786:[Elf]Shadowkin, cursed by darkness long ago, unable to return to light. Offer them your own spirit force to help keep the turmoil at bay.
2787:You sneak up on the figure and strike it down!{}{}{}{}The body withers away into dust and a release of strong turmoil magic shakes the ground, but it dissolves safely. The body turns to black ash, although you also discover specks of silver dust in it.{}{}
2788:The body withers away into dust and a release of strong turmoil magic shakes the ground, but it dissolves safely. The body turns to black ash, although you also discover specks of silver dust in it.{}{}
2789:The figure turns to you. You now see their features as thin -- gaunt, even -- their eyes empty and black, their skin covered in black veins. Despite this damage, you recognise the figure as an elf. They speak in a slow, tired voice:{}{}{}{}'I was only trying to rest, to feel the connection... but all I can do is destroy. Leave before I destroy you as well...'
2790:You feel tendrils of dark magic assailing you. Attack with magic!
2791:Speak to the elf's elder nature, demanding that they stand tall and face this corruption.
2792:'You failed, you failed, WHY! Fools...{}{}{}{}You now identify the figure as some sort of elf, although one covered in dark, pulsating veins, with empty, black eyes and a gaunt, nearly lifeless body. The elf walks off, and you feel a heavy curse falling upon you.
2793:'You thirst for blood, then cower in fear, meek and cowardly...' {}{}{}{}The figure leaves, and the ground beneath you shakes. The air grows icy cold and the skies darken as black mist infects your souls!
2794:Your ritual calls upon the threads of magic as well as your connection to the cosmic pantheon. {}{}{}{}A force of pure light strikes the figure, and you sense that they did not resist. In fact, you feel they aided your efforts. {}{}{}{}The light burns the flesh and soul of the creature, leaving only black ash, although you discover specks of silver dust in it.
2795:'Mere words cannot cleanse me, but you have awakened some hope within my heart. I will go where I can do no damage, and I will try for control once more. Perhaps even follow this path of yours... You have my thanks.' {}{}{}{}They leave behind a gift and depart.
2796:The figure does not respond to your words, only looks at you with despair. They move away from you quickly, but you feel their dark energy lingering on your souls. 
2797:You use your connection to the gods and your own shadow nature to give your kin balance, though you feel your own spirit wounded from the effort. They rise and bow in your honour:{}{}{}{}'You gave me a breath of life that I thought was extinguished. I had always assumed that if I could not be elven, I could be nothing, but this is not true. Thank you.'{}{}{}{}The shadowkin bows again, hands you a gift, and then disappears into the dark.
2798:'Mere words cannot cleanse me, but you have awakened some hope within my heart. I will go where I can do no damage, and I will try for control once more. Perhaps even follow this path of yours... You have my thanks.' {}{}
2799:Seeing that your own connection to turmoil does not overwhelm your being, the shadowkin bows in acceptance of your gift. {}{}{}{}You connect your spirits and feel your soul draining into theirs.
2800:Continue to heal them.
2801:Change your mind. Tell them they must find their own path, and then leave.
2802:'Your wisdom and sacrifice humble me, brethren. I wish to follow the path that gave my once arrogant and stubborn kin this much balance and freedom.'
2803:Refuse them. Say they must learn their own path, and then leave.
2804:'You gave me a breath of life that I thought was extinguished. It warms my heart to see that my brethren have not yet abandoned us entirely. I thank thee.'{}{}{}{}The shadowkin bows again, hands you a gift, and then disappears into the dark.
2805:Some pineconettes and forest fairies try to defend the old leshy, but you kill them too. {}{}
2806:Gather the wood and leave.
2807:You struggle to pull the leshy out, but your efforts only make it worse. The forest guardian sinks before your eyes, but as he does, he exclaims, 'Yoou diiid...'{}{}{}{}If only the leshy had spoken faster. You'll never know if he wanted to say you tried or was angry that you made it worse. Either way, the situation leaves you feeling sad.{}{}
2808:You enter the forest and discover a hastily abandoned woodcutter camp. {}{}{}{}There is an overly large chunk of a tree that has been chopped down but not yet fully worked. You see a face, in great pain, staring back at you from the tree trunk!
2809:Speak to it.
2810:[Forest demon]You look in dismay upon the face of a dying leshy. Compel him to tell you what fiend did this so you may exact revenge!
2811:[Druid or leshy]Attempt to spark life back into the leshy.
2812:A nearly dead tree spirit? Good, leave it to die and gather the wood.
2813:It may be nearly dead, but better just let it be. Leave.
2814:'Huumph, hamph... hmmm.... Woords... difficult... aacorn.... plaant... haaastily...'{}{}{}{}The tree spits out a tiny acorn. 
2815:Take the acorn. Use your forest power to plant it properly and thus allow for the leshy's eventual rebirth.
2816:Plant the acorn and hope for the best.
2817:This seems valuable. Take the acorn.
2818:This is valuable -- risky, but valuable. Take the acorn.
2819:Leave the acorn be, and gather whatever wood is left here.
2820:You plant the acorn and know you did well. Your spirits are lifted and wits renewed.
2821:You take the acorn for yourself, and although it soon dies, its life force lingers and gives you clarity of mind.
2822:You take the acorn for yourself, and although it soon dies, its life force lingers and makes you weak with disease. However,  the acorn was able to summon a lesser demon to help you.
2823:You plant the acorn and know you did well when tiny roots delve into the ground before the ground swallows the seed. Your spirits are lifted by the deed.
2824:You plant the acorn and know you did well when tiny roots delve into the ground before the ground swallows the seed. Your spirits are lifted and wits renewed, but you also realise the acorn borrowed some of your life force to achieve this.
2825:You meditate and become one with the forest, singing its song and listening to its heartbeat. In tune with nature, you tug ever so gently on the woodland?s life force and weave it back into the fallen leshy. {}{}{}{}You see tiny roots sprout from under the fallen log, and you know the leshy will rise again someday soon.{}{}{}{}You can now gather fallen wood without dishonour.
2826:A pineconette joins you. Leave together.
2827:Great. Leave him to rest now.
2828:You meditate and become one with the forest, singing its song and listening to its heartbeat. {}{}{}{}Alas, it is too late for the fallen leshy to ever rise again.{}{}
2829:You gather the precious remains of the leshy and ignore the spirit's cries of pain.{}{}{}{}You feel the wind whistle with a sharp sting and the birds sing with a sad scowl. {}{}
2830:You walk through the forest and realise that the shrubbery beneath your feet is in turmoil as if it was alive.
2831:[Forest demon or elf]Speak to the forest folk and ask what is amiss here.
2832:Tread carefully and stay vigilant.
2833:Trample whatever is beneath you.
2834:Various pineconettes -- little sprites of the woodland -- perk up and speak:{}{}{}{}'Ah, forest folk.'{}{}{}{}'Holly crickets, good you spoke, sorry.'{}{}{}{}'What are you sorry for? We didn't do anything.'{}{}{}{}'Yeah, we were gonna...'{}{}
2835:Nod and ask whether there is any forest news.
2836:'Oh, yeah, go to that grove yonder. Our elders went to be evergreen, so for a short time, you can have good fortune there.{}{}{}{}Just don't pick them! Just kidding, I know you wouldn't.'
2837:'Nothing much, but there's a bad bear lives over yonder. He ate a bunch of us! Kill it, maybe?'
2838:Agree. Go attack the bear.
2839:Decline to interfere in the natural affairs of the forest. Leave.
2840:Try to tame the bear instead so it will not eat the pineconettes again.
2841:The bear submits to you, and you may now call on its prowess!{}{}{}{}The pineconettes are happy:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, yay!'
2842:You tamed the bear's nature, and it will now respect the forest folk. 
2843:You take a few measured steps and see various small creatures rumbling about in the shrubbery, clearly trying to make a lot of noise.
2844:Ask if they are okay.
2845:Kill the critters!
2846:'Oh, crap, they saw us!'{}{}{}{}'Um, eh... we're in trouble.'{}{}{}{}'Yes, trouble. Squirrel trouble.'{}{}{}{}'Squirrel? Really.'{}{}{}{}'Yeah... nasty things, they eat mushrooms and pinecones and acorns, yeah...'{}{}
2847:Agree to kill some squirrels. Ask for directions.
2848:A couple of little creatures similar to pinecones and mushrooms pipe up and show themselves:{}{}{}{}'Pineconettes, that's what you call us. And, well, if you catch the squirrels, we'll give you treasure.'
2849:Threaten the creatures into giving you the treasure in exchange for their lives.
2850:You stomp around, trying to squash the creatures, but you're not sure if you got them or just trampled some shrubbery. Still, at least it is quiet now.
2851:The creatures point you to where the evil squirrels live. {}{}{}{}The way leads through an ever-darker grove with tall, dry pine trees towering above and an eerie air of stillness, broken suddenly by a loud crunch!
2852:Duck down.
2853:You're very agile, so you duck out of the way and see that you were about to be bombarded with blueberry juice bombs, spiderweb balls, and honey darts. It would have made a right mess of your clothes.{}{}{}{}You hear snickering from the shrubbery, but you also find a gift with a 'Thanks for playing' message.
2854:You duck out of the way and see that you were about to be bombarded with blueberry juice bombs, spiderweb balls, and honey darts. It would have made a right mess of your clothes.{}{}{}{}You hear snickering from the shrubbery, but you also find a gift with a 'Thanks for playing' message.
2855:You fail to duck in time as a barrage of blueberry juice bombs, spiderweb balls, and honey darts flies your way. It makes a right mess of your clothes, and some of it makes you sick.{}{}{}{}You hear snickering from the shrubbery, but you also find a gift with a 'Thanks for playing' message.
2856:'Okay, okay, joke's over, here -- have some of our treasure. Now please leave.'{}{}{}{}'Yeah, yeah, go, scary person, go.'
2857:Say that was a good choice. Take the stuff and leave.
2858:Good. 
2859:You soon realise that you're talking to yourself, as the forest is quiet and the shrubbery motionless.
2860:'Yeah, yeah, kill them!'{}{}'What, no? They're forest folk.'{}{}'Shush, you, they eat us!'
2861:Agree to go kill the squirrels.
2862:You follow the path to where the evil squirrels should be, but all you find is a terrified hairy critter with big yellow eyes, greenish fur, bird's wings, and a god-awful stench. Before you can react, the creature flings a stink bomb at you, then runs off. You hear laughter underneath your feet.
2863:?
2864:'Yaya, you chased it away, good large person you are!'{}{}{}{}'Ha ha, it stink-bombed them, ha ha!'{}{}{}{}'Shh, they're big, they may eat us.'{}{}{}{}The little creatures scurry off into their forest home.
2865:Damn the little tricksters. Leave.
2866:Try to stomp out these creatures!
2867:You find the offending rodents and discover they are actually rabid squirrels. {}{}{}{}You manage to kill them quickly, but you get a few bites that could become infected.{}{}{}{}The little creatures that 'hired' you are nowhere to be found, but you find a good stash of supplies waiting for you.
2868:The bear is a beast of the wild and cannot be tamed. Exhausted from the attempt, you are forced to flee.
2869:The bear is defeated. The pineconettes are happy:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, yay!'
2870:Among a small grouping of trees, you discover a circle of multicoloured mushrooms that emit a subtle yellow glow. 
2871:[Forest folk] You sense the power of forest sprites within. Go closer to ask for good fortune.
2872:Go in closer to investigate.
2873:As a creature of the woodland, you know the circle will give you blessings. {}{}{}{}But you could also try a more challenging path known as a greenwalk: entering the spiritual path of the forest and becoming one with it through this place of power. 
2874:Try the greenwalk.
2875:Take only the blessings. 
2876:You come closer and feel the yellow glow surround you. For those akin to nature, the glow is pleasant, but for others it may bring harm.{}{}{}{}When you try to step forwards, you feel a physical resistance, testing your spiritual resolve.
2877:Attempt the trial.
2878:Your spirit proved strong and you feel the warm glow embrace you, kindly. Whatever test this may have been, you clearly passed.
2879:You enter the swamps, where the air is thick with lingering darkness.
2880:Continue onwards.
2881:A low-hanging mist obscures the eerie swamps before you. {}{}{}{}It is dark, and you can barely see your path, but there seems to be a light flickering in the distance -- a campsite, perhaps?
2882:Follow the lights.
2883:Stay on your path.
2884:You walk towards the flickering light, deeper and deeper into the swamps. Yet you seem to get no closer to the source.
2885:Consider what this may be.
2886:Keep going.
2887:Try to turn around.
2888:Now that you think about it, these must be hochlicks or their cousins, jack-o-lanterns, tricky little things that like to lure folk into all sorts of trouble with their lantern-like butts.{}{}{}{}They have been known to hoard loot from unfortunates who fall to their trickery.
2889:Play dead and wait for them to come and investigate.
2890:You pretend to fall into the swamp and scream your dying words. Silence falls, and soon, the lights flicker ever closer. {}{}{}{}A swarm of tiny lights arrives, accompanied by a few larger hochlicks.{}{}{}{}'Dead, dead, is it dead?'{}{}'Why, oh why!'{}{}'No fun, this no fun. Does it have shiny gold?'
2891:Intimidate them.
2892:The challenge proved to be in catching the buggers, but once caught, they are easy enough to kill.{}{}{}{}You find some odd things they carried, but no real treasure.
2893:'No, scary big folk, no kill us!'{}{}{}{}The creatures scatter in a panic and drop whatever they carried to appease your anger.
2894:Your efforts prove futile and exhausting. Not only did you not deal with the hochlicks, but it took hours to find your way back to a safe path. You are cold, weak, and tired.
2895:Hours go by. The swamp gets darker and colder, the lights disappear, and you find yourself sinking in quicksand!
2896:Try to climb out before it sucks you in too deep.
2897:Stay calm and find a safe way to get out.
2898:You pull yourself out of the bog before it sucks you in completely. {}{}{}{}You hear laughter and see the flickering lights disappear. But you also discover the remains of a less fortunate soul, and you were able to retrieve them too.{}{}
2899:Eventually, you make it out of the bog, but it was a draining ordeal, and you feel exhausted. 
2900:The path you thought you came in on is sunken, the mist obscures your sight, and mosquitoes bug you at every step. You walk in circles for hours and feel mentally exhausted, but eventually you discover not only a way back, but also a sunken chest of goods thrown ashore by the shifts of the earth.
2901:The path you thought you came in on is sunken, the mist obscures your sight, and mosquitoes bug you at every step. You walk in circles for hours and feel mentally exhausted.{}{}{}{}Eventually, you find the way out.
2902:As you walk carefully through the muddy swamps, you hear a rustling nearby.
2903:In a puddle of mud, you see an overgrown toad-like creature with large warts, big yellow eyes, and a gaping wound on its hind leg.{}{}{}{}It cries in pain, but upon seeing you, it tries, unsuccessfully, to run away.
2904:Try to help it.
2905:Kill it. 
2906:As a healer, you're used to all sorts of strange creatures in need, so you are able to patch up this one with no trouble.{}{}{}{}The patient still looks scared of you, but it nods in thanks as its leg feels better. {}{}{}{}Some of its blood spilled on you, and while it stings and burns, it also heals any wounds you may have.
2907:Patch it up as best you can and leave it in peace. 
2908:As a wise one, you have heard of the cmuch, a shy swamp demon with a bad reputation for poisoning. {}{}{}{}Its real nature is more complex. Although it is true that the cmuch is attracted by weak, wounded folk and that its touch may kill such a person, it may also heal and strengthen.
2909:Stay away -- it may poison you.
2910:It looks like a toad, but it is likely a swamp demon known as a cmuch. They kill folk who are wounded or weak. Or at least that's what you heard.
2911:Help it anyway.
2912:The creature dies, and from its spores explodes a toxic green slime. It stings and burns where it lands on you, but it also heals any open wounds you have.
2913:The creature dies, and from its spores explodes a toxic green slime. It stings and burns badly.
2914:As you wander through some swamps, you come across a small pond and spot a young man half submerged in the water.{}{}{}{}He does not see you yet and seems deep in thought.
2915:[Befuddler]Greet your brother.
2916:[Water demon]A befuddler, a failed child of the rusalka. Shameful thing. Speak to him.
2917:Approach him and talk.
2918:He turns and smiles, a sad, forlorn kind of smile:{}{}{}{}'Brother. It is rare to meet one such as us. I suppose I may drop the pretence now.'{}{}
2919:Ask what he is doing here.
2920:'What we always do: try to impress the mothers.{}{}{}{}You know -- lure some females to reproduce with, or males to bedazzle, anything to show I am useful.'
2921:Nod with understanding and ask how it's been going.
2922:Say that this is not the only way to live, that he doesn't have to impress the mothers but can just live his own life.
2923:He looks down into the water and sheds a tear:{}{}{}{}'Most die... some run away...'
2924:He cannot be allowed to continue. Attack!
2925:Tell him practise makes perfect and wish him good fortune.
2926:'Thank you, brother, I will keep trying. Would you like to trade? I have gathered some things from those who... you know...'
2927:Yes, trade.
2928:No, say your farewells and leave.
2929:'I must go now. I feel a maiden approach on the other side of the pond. Farewell, brother!'
2930:Wave goodbye and leave.
2931:'Beautiful stranger, how your presence gladdens my lonely heart.'{}{}{}{}You sense an enchantment weaved into every sweet word that the boy utters. But you are strong, so you can talk to him without ill effects -- at least for now.
2932:Tell him you sense his trickery and that he'd best stop it now.
2933:'Oh, I see. So, you walk another path, away from the judgement of the mothers? How wonderful! Yes, I will try it too. Thank you! Please accept this gift.'
2934:Thank it and leave.
2935:'I am sorry, I was only trying to prove myself to the mothers. They left me to die, they said I was wrong, a male, neither of the father's kin nor truly of the mothers.'
2936:Ask more about this custom and the mothers.
2937:Nod, but say it is none of your business. You just don't take kindly to trickery.
2938:'Yes, I am sorry. Here, you took the time to talk, not fight. It is kind, so have this gift as my thanks.'
2939:'The rusalka are beautiful and kind, but they can be cold and mean too. Only females turn into nymphs. Males turn into the father's kin, die, or very rarely, they become like me, a befuddler.'
2940:Nod and wait for more.
2941:'We have some of our mother's charm, but it goes wrong. We lure females, but the children or the mates themselves die horribly. We are broken. But I am practising, and maybe I can do better.'
2942:'Beautiful stranger, how your presence gladdens my lonely heart.'{}{}{}{}His sweet words and melodic whispers are so enticing, you feel like joining him in the pond.
2943:Yes, join him. Why not?
2944:'That's nice for you, but I want mothers to like me... I feel a maiden approach on the other side of the pond. Farewell, brother!'
2945:You talk and talk, and before you realise it, you find yourself swept away by the boy's pure charm.{}{}{}{}Your spirit is drained and your body weakened before you manage to wrestle free and escape.{}{}
2946:A long time after the offending encounter, you walk past a pond and see a reflection of yourself with a child. {}{}{}{}The child then walks out of the pond and you know instinctively it is yours, somehow...
2947:You talk and talk, and before you realise it, you find yourself swept away by the boy's pure charm.{}{}{}{}By the time you come to your senses, the young man is gone. You feel your spirit drained, but other than that, you had a great time.
2948:'Beautiful stranger, how your presence gladdens my lonely heart.'{}{}{}{}His sweet words and melodic whispers are enticing but also slightly over the top. The young man looks sad:{}{}{}{}'You're not coming in? It didn't work?'
2949:Ask him what he means.
2950:He clearly meant to trick you. Attack!
2951:He turns and looks at you cautiously, then smiles in resignation:{}{}{}{}'It is rare to meet one such as me, although I suppose you do not see me as kin. Still, we are both water folk. I suppose I may drop the pretence now.'{}{}
2952:The creature is dead and its few belongings are now yours.
2953:The demon beats you badly and forces you to flee.
2954:You see before you some young saplings of elven wood. {}{}{}{}However, as you look up at the tree crowns, you see several bird-like figures sleeping, huddled together in a circle. {}{}{}{}Tiny swirls of wind dance around them, so you believe they must be the vily, wind demonettes and often forest guardians.
2955:It is said that the bodies of dead vily turn into dryad wood. Attack the creatures!
2956:Try to sneak past the vily to get to the elven wood.
2957:[Vily]Speak to your sisters and ask them for free passage.
2958:Whisper the greensong to appease the guardians and take only a little of the wood, so as not to destroy the forest's balance.
2959:The vily wake with a fury, wanting to punish you, but the greensong appeases them in the end, leaving you free to take the spoils. 
2960:The vily wake with a fury and swoop down, wanting to punish you for trespassing!{}{}{}{}You have a chance to escape, but not without a price. 
2961:Stay and fight them!
2962:The vily do not reply, and you know they are in a state of frenzy that cannot be easily calmed. But they let you pass and even collect some of the elven wood.
2963:The vily wake with a fury and swoop down, wanting to punish you for trespassing. You barely escape with your lives.
2964:You sneak past the sleeping forest guardians and gather the elven wood.{}{}
2965:As you travel through the swamps, you fall into a small bog. Within seconds you are swarmed by a mass of bulky, mud-like creatures that spit toxic goo at you!
2966:Remain calm and look for a way out.
2967:You run away, and although you got some nasty stings, you feel invigorated too.
2968:These are clearly swampers -- the younglings of mud trolls. They can be very dangerous in a swarm, but they are quite meek and typically friendly unless provoked.{}{}{}{}You stand still and take a few hits but make no threatening moves. The swampers stop bombarding you and scatter.{}{}{}{}Surprisingly, the swamper spit cured any wounds you may have had.{}{}
2969:You also spot the remains of their troll parent. Gather the loot and leave.
2970:The small mud creatures beat you, then scatter. To your dismay, you see the silhouettes of two mud trolls moving your way!{}{}{}{}You have to drop some bags to escape.
2971:Drop the bags and run.
2972:These are clearly swampers -- the younglings of mud trolls. They can be very dangerous in a swarm, but they are quite meek and typically friendly unless provoked.{}{}{}{}You try to stay calm and still, but the little creatures are terrified of you. They bombard you with a lot of their toxic mud before running away.{}{}
2973:Assert your kinship with the dwarves through the lord of light.
2974:'Haugh... yes, you are one tough son of the stone!'{}{}{}{}The other bandits nod in agreement, pat you on the back, and let you be on your way.{}{}
2975:'Aye, ya got us. We ain't cut out to be beatin' folk for no reason.{}{}{}{}We're banished, but we still have our honour. Thank ya for reminding us.{}{}{}{}If you like, we'll trade with ya, eh?'{}{}{}{}The dwarves also leave a small gift in thanks.
2976:'Enough talkin' -- we're takin the food, now!'
2977:'Aye, I see the mark of the great blacksmith upon you. Shite. We'd rather eat dirt than dishonour one human who knows his smithing.'{}{}
2978:'Oi, don't get yer undies in a twist, story goes that he was once human, that's all I am sayin'.'
2979:Ever since that odd dream, or even before that, you had a sense of the world being 'wrong.' It is a fleeting feeling, a butterfly that flutters in your gut every now and again.{}{}{}{}You ignored it before, but now its intensity makes you fall to your knees, and as you look around, searching for a reason, a black crow lands on a branch and stares at you intensely.
2980:This crow reeks of darkness. Attack it!
2981:Do nothing. It is merely a crow - either a beast of nature or a harbinger of mystery, but still, only one crow. Leave it be, but observe it.
2982:Reach out to the creature to show that you are no danger to it and you wish to communicate. Perhaps it requires aid, or perhaps it is a servant of magic and will share some knowledge with you.
2983:'True to your path, as you were when you taught Zbigniev the price of cowardice. {}{}{}{}I detest such crude tools, but I suppose you are as you were carved by your god, and thus I commend you for walking the path truly.'
2984:Ask the crow what it wants from you. Why does it speak of your divine duties?
2985:'True to your path, as you were when you taught Zbigniev the price of cowardice. {}{}{}{}I detest such crude tools, but light has ever been the path favouring direct action, and thus I commend you for walking the path truly.'
2986:The crow speaks as it soars above you. Was it ever on the branch?{}{}{}{}'Your actions are sound, but is it the path your domain would demand? Or did you choose on a moment's whim, without considering your true path? There is much for you to learn, chosen.'{}{}
2987:Say that it was not your choice, but another chosen who took that path!
2988:'True to your path, as you were when you showed that odd creature, Zbigniev, the value of reason.{}{}{}{}I wholly admire such a steadfast approach. One will inevitably learn so much more from careful consideration than from rushed action.'
2989:'True to your path, as you were when you showed that odd creature, Zbigniev, the value of reason.{}{}{}{}I wholly admire such a steadfast approach. One should never interfere in the natural cycles unless one absolutely must.'
2990:'True to your path, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen. {}{}{}{}But then Turmoil is all about the unpredictable, right?' 
2991:'True to your path, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen. {}{}{}{}Light favours direct action. You should have been firmer with that failure of a man. Still, let us not dwell on it.'
2992:'True to your path, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen, did you? {}{}{}{}You chose either to kill the man or to soothe his soul. Neither of these would I call the path of reason.{}{}{}{}One will inevitably learn so much more from careful consideration than from rushed action.'
2993:'True to your path, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen, did you?{}{}{}{}You chose either to kill the man or to soothe his soul, but why interfere so?{}{}{}{}One should never interfere in the natural cycles unless one absolutely must.'
2994:'True to your path, now as you were when you showed the failed chosen mercy and compassion.{}{}{}{}Personally, I do not like such emotional interference, but it is truly the path of Harmony that you walk as you were asked to do.'
2995:'True to your path, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen, did you? {}{}{}{}You did not choose to soothe the man's broken soul or to offer solace. A shame for one supposedly walking the path of Harmony.'
2996:'I am no one of importance, at least not to you. But I do have a question for you:{}{}{}{}Why are you needed? Why don't your gods send armies of chosen to solve this world-shattering problem? And do you think you have reached your true potential yet, chosen one?'
2997:Say that you do not question the will of the gods. Surely they have their reasons.
2998:Say that you walk your own path and care little for what the gods think.
2999:Admit that the question has crossed your mind and ask if it has answers.
3000:The crow shrugs (as much as is possible for a bird), but says nothing.
3001:'Obedient, good, but the gods rarely need their chosen to follow blindly. Trust in the gods but remain vigilant.{}{}{}{}If you wish to unlock your true potential, you must find out why the gods remain weak. Follow your divine path and search for the truth.'
3002:Follow Nature's domain.
3003:Follow Turmoil.
3004:Find Harmony's path.
3005:Light guides your journey.
3006:Trust in Intellect to lead you.
3007:Seek out the path of Magic. 
3008:'True to your path, as you were when you faced the failed chosen, Zbigniev, and decided to spare his life, for he did not offend your path in any way.{}{}{}{}Personally, I am ever cautious of the weaves of magic and their chaotic ways, but it is truly the path of Magic that you walk, as you were asked to do.'
3009:'True to your path, seeking knowledge before action, at least this time. You did not stay on this path when dealing with the failed chosen, did you?{}{}{}{}Personally, I am ever cautious of the weaves of magic and their chaotic ways, so it is hard to question your path here, and yet the gods choose to do so.'
3010:'Wilful, independent - good. But remember: there are times when obedience is needed and wilfulness can lead you astray. {}{}{}{}If you wish to unlock your true potential, you must find out why the gods remain weak. Follow your divine path and search for the truth.'
3011:'An inquisitive mind is the brightest, yes. I do, but I will not share them with you. I am merely here to point you in the right direction.{}{}{}{}If you wish to unlock your true potential, you must find out why the gods remain weak. Follow your divine path and search for the truth.'
3012:'True to your path, even though it is filled with contradictory domains.{}{}{}{}Thus, I commend you for walking the path truly.'{}{}
3013:You come to the abandoned ruins of a stone-built chram, which some would call a temple in the western dialects. {}{}{}{}Apart from the silence and dust, you see surprisingly few signs of decay. There are two distinct places of offering in the centre of the chram. You see symbols similar to those of the cosmic pantheon, but you do not recognise the deity worshipped here.
3014:[Zerca]Examine the symbols closely.
3015:[Elf]Your people have longer memories than mere mortals do. Try to remember what these symbols may be.
3016:Take a closer look.
3017:These markings are related to the old supreme god, Perun, often called the father. He was the god of thunder and husband to the creator of the pantheon, Mokosh. {}{}{}{}As powerful as they were, centuries ago, not long after the great victory of the Awakening, they simply vanished. {}{}{}{}What is odd, though, is that these markings are not quite right. They seem merged with another, and you see markings suggesting an offspring, rather than the god himself.{}{}
3018:Examine the second part.
3019:There is no sign of the crow that sent you here, but you feel that you are in the right place.{}{}{}{}There are two altars, so you are likely expected to leave an offering to the gods. 
3020:Focus on your domain in the hopes that it will guide you correctly.
3021:Spend time to really study this place so you can find the right path.
3022:Try to guess. Place random objects on both altars.
3023:This is the place the crow sent you to unlock your true potential, but your chosen is not with you, or you are not the chosen that first began this path, so it seems you cannot enter.
3024:This one is even more obscure. Your teacher told you once of the lady of death and rebirth, a mistress of winter that sacrificed herself each cycle to bring about spring. Morena or Marzanna was her name.{}{}{}{}Perhaps this chram is a place of worship for a child of the two gods. Thus, the two altars will likely honour Turmoil for Perun and Nature for Morena. You know that you need to place an offering on only one of the altars.
3025:For the offering to Turmoil, which is your lead domain, offer a good quality melee weapon as tribute.
3026:For the offering to Turmoil, which is your lead domain, offer any melee weapon as tribute, as you do not have a good one to offer.
3027:A generous amount of cooked food is appropriate for any divine offering. Lay down yours on the right altar.
3028:An offering of a little cooked food is appropriate for any divine tribute. Lay down yours on the right altar.
3029:You do not feel that you have the right tribute. Either your weapons need to be crafted from better materials, or you need to bring more food. Leave for now.
3030:Offer the ultimate sacrifice to appease any god - a life.
3031:The chram shakes and a gust of wind throws dust in your eyes. After you rub it away, you see the chram through a thin veil of green light, but as it must have stood many centuries ago. A voice issues forth and a spirit appears soon after:{}{}{}{}'I accept your offering, chosen. What seek you here?'
3032:Say that you came to unlock your true potential as the chosen.
3033:Say that you come seeking knowledge. Ask the voice what this place is, as you have not heard of a god or goddess bearing these symbols.
3034:Show your mark of Svarog with pride.
3035:'Yes, this is clear. I have granted you my boon, for your offering was true. But this is hardly what you seek. {}{}{}{}As the world shattered, so has the memory of your divine. If you can piece together the past, your future will hold strong. Tell me, whose path do you walk, chosen?'
3036:Say that you follow Zorya.
3037:You are chosen of Triglav!
3038:Say you follow Stribog.
3039:'Knowledge of what was lost will indeed guide you to your future. I am surprised you were led here, to me, but then again, who better to tell you of things forgotten, buried?'
3040:Ask him who he is.
3041:'Jarillo is my name, although it is not a name you have likely heard spoken in Thea. {}{}{}{}I am the son of Perun, once the mighty father of the cosmic pantheon, now it seems a faded memory, like me. How ironic...'
3042:Ask him why you were sent here. What does it have to do with unlocking your potential?
3043:His father was Perun? Why isn't he a god of the pantheon, then?
3044:The chram shakes and a gust of wind throws dust in your eyes. After you rub it away, you see the chram through a thin veil of green light, but as it must have stood many centuries ago. A voice issues forth:{}{}{}{}'Your offering is insulting, chosen. What seek you here?'
3045:Your divine connection allows you to sense the remains of faith in this chram. You see faint images of souls long gone and you know the two altars correspond to the two domains this deity served: Turmoil and Nature. You know that you need to place an offering on only one of the altars.
3046:For the offering to Turmoil, which is your lead domain, offer any melee weapon as tribute.
3047:A generous offering of cooked food is considered appropriate for deities of nature. Lay down yours on the right altar.
3048:An offering of a little cooked food is considered appropriate for deities of nature. Lay down yours on the right altar.
3049:You cannot figure out what needs to be done here, beyond placing some kind of offering on the altars.
3050:The altars stand ready to accept your offerings.
3051:Place two good weapons.
3052:Place a lot of cooked food on the altars.
3053:Place any two weapons. 
3054:Give a blood offering - sacrifice a person.
3055:Sacrifice a farm animal. 
3056:No, you do not feel ready. Leave.
3057:Your weapons sink into the stone, but nothing happens. Clearly that was not the right offering.
3058:The chram shakes and a gust of wind throws dust in your eyes. After you rub it away, you see the chram through a thin veil of green light, but as it must have stood many centuries ago. A voice issues forth:{}{}{}{}'I accept your offering, chosen. It has been long since anyone honoured me with a life. What seek you here?'
3059:The chram shakes and a gust of wind throws dust in your eyes. After you rub it away, you see the chram through a thin veil of green light, but as it must have stood many centuries ago. A voice issues forth:{}{}{}{}'I accept your offering, chosen. It has been long since anyone honoured me with blood. It is not my preferred tribute, but it shows respect. What seek you here?'
3060:'Memory of my father faded, but his might remains. To know your own path, you must follow my father's first.{}{}{}{}I know where his rod lies buried. Go to the ice plains. Find the rod and hold it in your hands. If you are worthy, Perun will surely reward you with the clarity you seek.'{}{}{}{}The spirit fades away and the place turns to ruin once more.
3061:Thank him for his help and leave.
3062:'Zorya, Svarog's favoured daughter and my father's most valiant rival. {}{}{}{}I too walked the path of war, and perhaps this is why I was never allowed to ascend, for your goddess does not play well with others or share her bright spotlight.'{}{}{}{}You see the spirit ripple with red veins but it passes quickly.
3063:'I can see the black feather of the wise crow on your shoulder, chosen. Interesting, for she swore never to get involved again.{}{}{}{}Still. As I understand it, your gods have forgotten who they are. Not entirely, of course, but they are acting out of instinct, unrooted. {}{}{}{}There is a reason. I do not know it, but I suspect my father's fate has everything to do with it.'
3064:His father's fate?
3065:'I was for a brief time. But my divine spark faded as my followers diminished. Some will say I failed to inspire them, that I was not ready.{}{}{}{}Others will say Mokosh is not the homely mother that folk think her to be. And am I not her son, after all?'
3066:And the truth?
3067:Who is Mokosh?
3068:'I do not wish to speak of her. She is the mother of all the gods of the Tree. She is gone now too. Good.'
3069:'If I admit to the first, will you admire my humility and grant me sympathy, maybe even rage at the injustice of it all - and will you not later think: but did he only say it to make himself look good? And if I say it was her, will you not assume a scorned child's anger directs my words?{}{}{}{}It matters little now. I am what I am. I thank you for the visit, but my time here fades.'
3070:'Hmm, fascinating, and yet you search for the truth still? {}{}{}{}Well, chosen of the god of anger and flames, beware of your temper. Listen to your hidden self, not just the surface wrath that you were moulded from. {}{}As my father Perun once told me, war cannot sustain your soul forever.'
3071:'Ah, my elder brother, so loved by my father, his right hand, his sun...{}{}{}{}I often feel he stole the light from me, but that is childish, I know it.'
3072:'Ah, this one I know little of, he came when I was already but a memory. {}{}{}{}But seeing as his domain is that of water and the winds, the sky and the seas, I imagine both my father Perun and his eternal lady Mokosh, were pleased to welcome him...'{}{}{}{}You see the spirit ripple with red veins but it passes quickly.
3073:The strange crow marked this place on the map and said you would find divine truth here, but when you approach, all you see is the stump of an ancient oak, hollow and forlorn.{}{}{}{}Beside it, you see a bustling of light swirling in and out, trying to carve its way inside, but unable to break through. Some of these light creatures look humanoid. They may be lightbringers, although they seem to be acting much livelier and more chaotic than the ones you've come across so far.
3074:Approach carefully. After all, you were supposed to find enlightenment here, not fight.
3075:One of the light creatures turns to you. It is the husk of an older human, but his hair is burnt and light escapes through every orifice. His presence is blinding.{}{}{}{}'You, I sense you are made of this tree. Perhaps you can aid us in breaking it?'
3076:Ask who they are first. They seem slightly different than the lightbringers.
3077:[Harmony]You sense the overwhelming power of this light. It calls even to you, promising harmony. But you know this to be a lie. Open yourself up to your domain and try to show the truth to these lightbringers.
3078:[Nature]You sense great conflict within these creatures. Tell them you can guide them to true illumination and help them be free again by calling upon their natural bonds, and not those of the light-hive.
3079:'We are the bringers of light, as you call us. But this place, this stump, it is making us corrupted, so we must proceed...we must stop it so the light can be free.'
3080:Why should you aid an enemy?
3081:Ask if this has anything to do with the red cave, the light beast.
3082:'Enemy? We are of light. We come to bring tranquillity. We sense light or harmony inside of you too, no?'{}{}
3083:The creature's eyes flicker, and they all turn to you for a second before going back to work:{}{}{}{}'The light must be freed. You must not interfere. Surely you, who are made of light and harmony, will aid us?'
3084:You open yourself up to the light through your love for Harmony, and through it, to face the lightbringers. {}{}{}{}Your will and the power of the true light that you serve overwhelm them. Sadly, most of them perish, as if the unnatural link to the light-mind was their only remaining life force. One remains, weakened but flickering with a more familiar warmth.
3085:Ask them if they are okay.
3086:Leave the light be and approach the tree stump. [Skip story]
3087:'I am... alone. And yet, this light you showed me, dirty, ever entwined with darkness, but, so?I don't know how to speak of it. Thank you. I think?'
3088:Ask them to tell you all they know of the lightbringers.
3089:Ask what they were doing here. Why try to destroy this tree?
3090:'I am alone. I do not know. I feel a faint imprint of us, but it is fleeting. The light in the earth is strong, burning, trying to come out so badly. But it cannot. The earth holds it still.{}{}{}{}Oh, yes. Here, this tree, a root of one you call Mokosh, earth mother, tree sister. Bad. Bad, there is another such root, bigger, stronger. We were to go there too, destroy it all!{}{}{}{}I...I must leave, find my own way?'
3091:Tell them they could stay with you.
3092:'No, I must not. You have a path to walk. I am unlinked now, but they may take me again. I will go, hide.'{}{}{}{}The light moves away. {}{}{}{}'Go, find the big root. Earth mother smells like you too. Maybe there you will find the answers you seek.'
3093:Thank them and go check on the tree.
3094:The tree stump is scorched and bruised, but you see fresh vines of greenery growing on it and giving it renewed life. {}{}{}{}As you come closer, you feel the touch of the divine upon you and a call that beckons you to find another such place in the lands of the ancient forest. 
3095:Bow in thanks and leave.
3096:The lightbringers are too strong. Their power overwhelms you and threatens to take you hostage like so many others. {}{}{}{}You are forced to flee before it is too late for all.
3097:The lightbringers lie destroyed. Some of their bodies turn to ash, and some become empty, burned husks, while the svatelko simply fade away.{}{}{}{}The tree stump is safe, but as the chosen of Harmony, you feel shamed by this aggression when another path was given.
3098:Go see to the tree.
3099:The lightbringers lie destroyed. Some of their bodies turn to ash, some become empty, burned husks, while the svatelko simply fade away.{}{}{}{}The tree stump is safe, and as the chosen of light, you feel uplifted by the deed.
3100:Your voice, reinforced by the power of Nature, soothes the lightbringers. They listen, and you see a glimmer of recognition in their eyes as their unnatural bondage breaks.{}{}{}{}Sadly, most of them perish, as if the link to the light-mind was their only remaining life force. One remains, weakened but flickering with a more familiar warmth.
3101:You come to a place steeped in the energy of darkness and weaves of magic all around you. You see the broken statue of a zmey wound around a silver tree. {}{}
3102:[Shaman]Your spirit sense is going crazy - try to focus. 
3103:Take a closer look. The crow said this is the place you need to visit to unlock your true potential.
3104:[Nyia]You sense the presence of many navka here, servants of yours that aid the passage of souls into the underworlds. Speak to them.
3105:The veil to the greyworld is almost non-existent here. You see many spirits flow past you, and among them, souls of the dead float around the statue, as if waiting in a queue.
3106:Approach the statue.
3107:One of the navka stops and looks at you. You sense that their energy is yours, but also another's - something much older, something you should know but can't quite put your finger on. It speaks:{}{}{}{}'Mistress of death, you come here finally, but I sense no recognition in you. This gate remains shut until Veles returns, but the light tries to come here, so we must protect it.'
3108:Why do you now know all this? Surely Nyia should remember Veles?
3109:The stone zmey's eyes open and a slithering voice whispers into your ear:{}{}{}{}'Ah, chosen, finally. Thiss iss one of the ressting placess of Veless. As ssuch, it hass become a natural gateway into the underworld. {}{}{}{}But creaturess of the light-hive are determined to usse thiss gate to desstroy the underworld, or at leasst the gatess. Thiss musst not happen.'
3110:But Nyia is the mistress of death. Why does your god not remember this?
3111:Who is he, exactly?
3112:Ask what needs doing here. [Skip story]
3113:'Nyia iss mistress of death, Veless wass gatekeeper and guardian of ssoulss. When the old godss left, they created the divine domainss, gave powerss to their children, relinquisshed their own.'
3114:Why?
3115:'Sso many questionss. Answerss come after. Once you ssecure thiss gate, you will become sstronger, you will remember what your god needss from you. And I will ansswer more questionss.'
3116:So how can you secure the gate?
3117:'There are sseveral wayss to give me more sstrength sso I can hold thiss gate. There are many soulss here, but none marked by the chossen's aura. Ssacrifice sspiritss that walk with you, and I sshall be sstrengthened. {}{}{}{}Blood, given freely, a life - that hass the potency I sseek. {}{}{}{}For the more prosaic of optionss, certain high-quality resourcess in large amountss will alsso sserve me. {}{}{}{}Lasstly, you can defeat the light creaturess that linger here. I sshall ssiphon them while you fight.'
3118:Sacrifice four spirits to aid the zmey.
3119:Choose one of your people to lay down their life for the cause.
3120:See if you have the right resources to give.
3121:Seek out the lightbringers.
3122:Leave for now. 
3123:'I am Zmey, or am I jusst a zmey? The god Veless accepted much darknesss when he became divine, when he carried the burden of magic and the underworldss. I gave him thiss darknesss, and he became a part of me, and I of him. {}{}{}{}Thuss here, where he sshed his exisstence, I remain in his sstead, guarding the gate.'
3124:'We do not know, lady. Ask the snake - he keeps vigil here, he knows.'
3125:Look for the snake.
3126:You see a strong group trying to push past a dark barrier. The barrier is weakening - there are several holes already, and some sviatelko are getting through and helping from the inside.
3127:Face them spiritually!
3128:The lightbringers are destroyed and you see their light float towards the zmey. His stone mouth is ajar now, devouring the energy and turning it black. {}{}{}{}You see and feel the barriers strengthen. They even put pressure on your presence here. 
3129:Remain calm.
3130:The lightbringers defeat you and take one of you into their light-hive. They continue to push the barrier, and you see the zmey is getting weaker. 
3131:You also feel the domains of Magic and Intellect stirring. Awareness of the old god Veles fills you up. You know he was once an elven sage who turned to the human world and decided to carry the burden of the divine. You know he gave magic to mortals, and valued wisdom above all. {}{}{}{}You know that your own domain came from him too, and you feel it strengthen you.
3132:Accept the gifts of Magic.
3133:Receive the wisdom of Intellect.
3134:As chosen, you feel the power of Magic flow through you and make you stronger. One of Veles's spirits is drawn to your power and joins you.{}{}{}{}But you feel there is much more potential within you. You feel your divine connection calling out to you.
3135:Ask the zmey what now.
3136:As chosen, you feel the power of Magic flow through you. Knowledge of the arcane becomes clear as day, even if you were not blessed by it before. {}{}{}{}You are now a magic user, and you have gained the skills of those who can wield the power. {}{}{}{}But you feel there is much more potential within you. You feel your divine connection calling out to you.
3137:As chosen, you feel the power of Intellect flow through you and enlighten your mind. You feel your thoughts becoming sharper and your wisdom greater. {}{}{}{}But you feel there is much more potential within you. You feel your divine connection calling out to you.
3138:As chosen, you feel the power of Intellect flow through you and enlighten your mind. {}{}{}{}You now possess the wisdom and divine blessing of the zerca, and the skill to research knowledge.{}{}{}{}But you feel there is much more potential within you. You feel your divine connection calling out to you.
3139:'Now you know I sspeak true. Veless wass one of the three who needed to give up their sseat sso the new godss may rule. {}{}{}{}You will find the final ansswer when you unlock your own divine path. Your god'ss power will be freed and thuss truth will be revealed. Now go, follow your path.'
3140:Follow the path of Marovit.
3141:Follow the path of Zorya.
3142:Follow the path of Nyia.
3143:Follow the path of Horz.
3144:Follow the path of Lada.
3145:'Marovit, born of both Magic and Intellect, thuss a sson of Veless to be ssure. {}{}{}{}Marovit wass once a great sshaman, posssesssing the wissdom of the sspirit world. When hiss ssoul crosssed into the greyworld, the lord Veless sspoke to him and thuss the young god emerged. To find Marovit'ss memoriess, you musst venture into the landss of darknesss. There, your final tesst will await.'
3146:Thank the zmey and leave.
3147:'The aurora goddesss, the three and the one. It iss not ssurprissing to me that sshe took on the mantle of Magic, for it iss a domain as chaotic as the lady hersself. Veless chose well in gifting the sstar hiss power. {}{}{}{}Zorya'ss many naturess need to be united sso that sshe and you may become more. Go to the lands of her chosen children, the volcanic wasstelands where sshe is called Zorza and hailed ssupreme. The daughter of Ssvarog hass never ssuffered from humility...'
3148:'The masster of the moon wass born with Magic racing in hiss veinss, sso it iss fitting that he wass besstowed the domain. Like Veless, Horz remainss forever conflicted between hiss dark sside and hiss duty to balance and the divine. {}{}{}{}The light of the moon hass forever guided hiss path, but thiss new sscourge is obscuring it. Sseek out the children of the night that hide on the metallic landss or the sscorched volcanic fieldss. There you will find your final challenge.'
3149:'Nyia'ss path to divinity wass not an easy one. Sshamed for ssiding with darknesss a long time ago. Plagued by missguided followerss who defiled our lawss in her name.{}{}{}{}And yet, with Morena gone and Veless too, sshe did not cower from her duty, nor whine about passt wrongss. Many fear her, and with good reasson. Within her hollowed heart, you musst ignite a sspark or sshe will never truly wake.'
3150:The zmey accepts your sacrifice. His stone mouth is ajar now, devouring the life given to him and turning it into dark energy. {}{}{}{}You see and feel the barriers strengthen. They even put pressure on your presence here. 
3151:'Ah yess, the goddesss of love, hope, and other ssuch ssweetness, and yet one that hass become ssharp and thoughtful with age. Sshe can bring hope, but alsso take it away - a terrible power, if you assk me.{}{}{}{}The domain of Intellect wass gifted to the child of hope, for it iss her tassk to guide the pantheon now that the mother and father are gone. Sseek out her final tassk for you in the landss of the Ancient Foresst or the frozen plainss.'{}{}
3152:You come to the place the crow sent you to unlock your chosen path. It is a hillside with a small pine grove atop it. It seemed like nothing was here at first, but you feel the pull of the divine, and as you follow it, you notice a gathering of hooded figures performing a ritual.
3153:[Witch]They are witches performing a burial for a sister. But it is not a ritual you recognise. Approach and greet the coterie.
3154:[Zerca]They seem to be performing a burial rite that is unknown to you, yet strangely familiar. Approach them politely and speak to them.
3155:Do not interfere, but stay and observe.
3156:One of the witches steps aside and approaches you calmly. She takes off her hood and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ah, sister of the young gods. Welcome. May I ask how you broke our protection veil?'
3157:Tell her of the crow and how it guided you here.
3158:'A crow, you say? So she decides to meddle after all. Interesting.{}{}{}{}We are the viedma coterie, and we walk the path of Veles, even though his name is but a whisper now. We perform the rite of passage into his care for our fallen. When he returns, she will await him.'
3159:Nyia is the mistress of death. Who is this Veles they speak of? A demon?
3160:One of the witches steps aside and approaches you calmly. She takes off her hood and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ah, a wise one of the young gods. Welcome. May I ask how you broke our protection veil?'
3161:'She is now. She was ever a servant of death, and two others stood above her in the past. {}{}{}{}Veles is not a harbinger of death. He is gatekeeper and master of the underworlds. {}{}{}{}If you truly walk the chosen path, you will sacrifice something precious to us. Only then will we share the enlightenment you seek here.'
3162:Ask more about this Veles first. Why do the witches worship a forgotten god?
3163:Agree and offer them the entire spirit essence of one person.
3164:Agree and offer them the entire mental essence of one person.
3165:Blood is the most potent of essences for witchcraft, especially if given freely. Offer to bleed one of you entirely for the witches. 
3166:Decline and attack!
3167:[Magic user]Instead of an offering, challenge the witch to a spiritual duel in line with ancient traditions.
3168:The witch nods and the coterie takes the blood sacrifice. She turns to you again:{}{}{}{}'As those who worship Veles, we are not allowed to take blood from an unwilling host. Thus, your sacrifice will serve us well indeed. Your path of intellect or magic serves you well.{}{}{}{}Here, drink this and receive the gifts of our father.'
3169:Accept the gifts, but ask if this is all.
3170:'All? It is but a humble beginning of your path, dear chosen. We spoke of our father to you, but even we are veiled from his true self, memories fading, traditions falling. {}{}{}{}You must go to the ancient forest and there seek out the burial of our father. We will pray that you learn of his fate there and, in doing so, unlock your own power and that of your deity.'
3171:The witch nods and the coterie siphons the sacrifice. She turns to you again:{}{}{}{}'The essence of the mind is a precious gift indeed. Your path of intellect or magic serves you well.{}{}{}{}Here, drink this and receive the gifts of our father.'
3172:'He gave magic to the mortals, of course. Thus we honour him still.'
3173:Marovit is the keeper of magic. Horz also masters this domain. Are they related to this Veles?
3174:So what happened to this god?
3175:'They are now, but they were not so in the past. The gods are not stagnant. They change as we do, as the world does.'
3176:'We do not know. It is as if a shroud was cast over all our minds. We know our father, yet we do not. {}{}{}{}And your gods seem similarly afflicted, disjointed from their full selves. Thus you as their chosen are equally broken, or at least un-whole.'
3177:Ask again how you can find out the full story.
3178:'If you truly walk the chosen path, you will sacrifice something precious to us. Only then will we share the enlightenment you seek here.'
3179:You kill the witches, but some escape. There is a deadly silence that rings hollow in your ears. {}{}{}{}As chosen, you feel a terrible shame befall you. You came to seek knowledge of your domain, to unlock secrets of your gods and perhaps yourself too, but instead you slaughtered the witches.{}{}
3180:Try to look for some clues here.
3181:You see one of the witches who survived watching you from afar. She speaks and you hear her voice as clearly as if she stood in front of you:{}{}{}{}'You have murdered the daughters of Veles. I would expect this of Zorya's pets, perhaps even her mate's beasts, but one who claims to follow Intellect or Magic? How odd.'
3182:'The crow saw fit to send you here and she is of our father's kin, so I will tell you where your path leads next, but if we meet again, I will drink your blood, fiend.{}{}{}{}You must go to the ancient forest and there seek out the burial of our father. We will pray that you learn of his fate there and, in doing so, unlock your own power and that of your deity.'{}{}{}{}The witch is no longer where she stood - she is gone.
3183:You are badly beaten and cursed by the witch coterie. You see one of the witches watching you with disdain:{}{}{}{}'You tried to murder the daughters of Veles. I would expect this of Zorya's pets, perhaps even her mate's beasts, but one who claims to follow Intellect or Magic? How odd.'
3184:The witch bows to your skill:{}{}{}{}'You are indeed a chosen of Magic or Intellect to wield such precise power. I accept this as your offering and will grant the knowledge you seek.{}{}{}{}Here, drink this and receive the gifts of our father.'
3185:'You are not yet worthy of the challenge, dear child. Come back when you are ready to face us, or offer the sacrifice to gain what you seek.'
3186:One of the witches steps aside and approaches you calmly. She takes off her hood and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ah, a chosen of the young gods. Welcome. May I ask how you broke our protection veil?'
3187:As you wander the lands of darkness, a spirit approaches you:{}{}{}{}'You carry the essence of the spirit master of old. Are you kin of Marovit?'
3188:'You are close to where he met his downfall - or where he became more, depending on whom you ask.{}{}{}{}I have waited to guide you there so you may know yourself and be tested.'
3189:Tell the spirit to lead the way. 
3190:You enter into a shroom grove and, among the many coloured spores, you see a goblin shaman brewing a potion. Beside him sits a much larger, more imposing figure surrounded by an aura of divinity, but the figure is faded, barely visible but for a faint reflection in the shroom light that surrounds you.{}{}{}{}The shaman turns to you, and you see he wears the face of Marovit:{}{}{}{}'Oh, guests? I go into trance soon. You want to join?'
3191:Bow to your god.
3192:Defiantly demand some answers!
3193:'Oh... am I supposed to know you, dearie? It feels like I should. It feels like I should do many things, but do not know. {}{}{}{}The spirits call to me in the greyworld. Surely that is my duty as one of the forefather shamans, but then I dream of this tree, and it tells me to move forwards, not back. What should I do?'
3194:Tell Marovit that you are his chosen and he may use this connection to find his path.
3195:'Oh... am I supposed to know you, dearie? It feels like I should, and from your angry stance, I suppose you are making some point. It feels like I should do many things, but do not know. {}{}{}{}The spirits call to me in the greyworld. Surely that is my duty as one of the forefather shamans, but then I dream of this tree, and it tells me to move forwards, not back. What should I do?'
3196:'Yes, yes. Long have spirits guided my journey, and so your soul and your past deeds will show me who I am. Come closer and do not fear what is to come.'{}{}{}{}As you find yourself in the embrace of Marovit, you feel your soul extracted from your husk and inhaled by your god. You now need to resist this onslaught through Magic or Intellect.
3197:[Chosen only]Focus on the spirit domain to strengthen your lord.
3198:[Chosen only]Brace your mind and allow your god to take strength from it.
3199:Retreat and return when you are truly ready!
3200:'Ha, yes, I sense our flock is devoted to my old self. Goblins or spirits hear my call well or those marked by the mystical force, yes? Good. {}{}{}{}I see it now, my days as shaman, spirit guide - this is the path I will choose. Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3201:What does it mean that he chose this path? Were there others?
3202:Why did he lose his memory in the first place? 
3203:Say that you seek no answers; the world awaits your return. Bow before your god and ask for a final blessing. 
3204:'I chose to follow my primal nature. This will affect you and me. For better or worse? We will see. {}{}{}{}You gave me clarity, chosen. I now understand the sacrifices made by the older gods and what we, the young, must do.'
3205:Why and how did he become a god?
3206:'When the three elder gods decided to create divine domains, they took power from all of us. I suspect this had its side effects.{}{}{}{}Veles gave his power to create Magic and Intellect, and I was gifted with both. As the most direct recipient of his power and one linked to spirits from birth, I was thus bound to the greyworld, ensuring the stable flow of souls into their afterlife. But this drained me, and I became lost.'
3207:'And so, the three were free to forge their domains and grant them back to us, so that we may face this new threat and others that will surely come.{}{}{}{}Their true essence was of course not lost. It is what held the world intact, despite the continuous tremors.'
3208:So they are gone for good?
3209:But why is the light bad? 
3210:'No, a part of each lived on and was reforged as the god you know as Triglav - the three as one, forged in fire to aid us in this hour of need.'
3211:But why the loss of memory, the tests, the chosen? Would they not wake without you?
3212:Triglav is really the three gods? 
3213:'They were our leaders, our strongest. Some in the pantheon would argue this, try to take their place, try to stop them. We are divine, but we are but reflections of your wills, and as such we are just as flawed.{}{}{}{}It was deemed safest that we do not know until our chosen are strong enough to unlock the truth. After all, your journey here already made you stronger, so you have proven your usefulness.'
3214:What now?
3215:'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Marovit walks away into the greyworld and you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3216:Take your gift.
3217:As you walk away, you feel your fate improved also.{}{}{}{}[As part of your final gift, you will gain a small chance of an unusual class choice when your children mature.]
3218:'Ha, yes, I sense that our flock is diverse. You did not focus on my birth kin, the goblins, nor on the path of the mystical above others. I also sense that you yourself wavered when following my domains, and thus I feel I must strengthen my divine path and let go of the past. This is good.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3219:'I chose to follow balance and the divine calling and not dwell on mortal attachments.{}{}{}{}You gave me clarity, chosen. I now understand the sacrifices made by the older gods and what we, the young, must do.'
3220:As you walk away, you feel your fate improved also.{}{}{}{}[As part of your final gift, you may choose one more bonus in accordance with your god's domains. This bonus will apply for children growing up.]
3221:Choose Magic and thus increase the chances of your children growing to be witches or shamans.
3222:Choose Intellect and thus increase the chances of your children growing to be zercas.
3223:'Does one ever choose to become divine? I suppose Horz did to impress his love, and Veles sought it out too. But for the rest of us, we were chosen in one way or another.{}{}{}{}I was the eldest and strongest of the goblin shamans, and Veles took notice of me. We played chess and conversed. He was curious about the greyworld and our special connection to it. He recognised that I do not seek power, but understanding, so he offered to become my father. I accepted.'
3224:'It is neither bad nor good, just like its sibling, darkness. They are both driven to obey their nature.{}{}{}{}You see, at first, there was balance as the two coexisted. But the child of darkness cannot stand still. They changed the world, they made new races - orcs, who sought to conquer, and goblins, who mastered the spirit realms.'{}{}
3225:You endure the process and see Marovit stand up stronger and full of vitality. He looks at you with a renewed spark in his eye and smiles. 
3226:Ask if it worked.
3227:You barely endure the process, but you see Marovit stand up stronger and full of vitality. He looks at you with a renewed spark in his eye and smiles. 
3228:'Humans were born out of both, but they seemed to favour darkness, ever pushing to meddle in dark arts and change their world. In fact, they proved even more unpredictable than the others.{}{}{}{}The child of light grew ever envious. They did not understand their sibling's drive for change. One day they decided the world was broken and must be purged.'
3229:'Their feud almost destroyed Thea, until the gods managed to finally cage the two. Darkness was locked in the skies and held there by the crown of the cosmic trees that grew throughout the lands.{}{}{}{}Light was sunk deep into the core of the earth, held in place by the sacrifice of the eldest of giants, Starovit, who gave his own heart as a seal. But the seal has clearly been broken, and thus the child of light threatens to purge the world again.'
3230:So the old gods are gone for good?
3231:'Triglav was born as Lada was once, in the hour of need, forged with a purpose. Lada needed to bring hope in times of darkness, and Triglav brought power in times of weakness. {}{}{}{}So, yes and no. They carry the will of all three elder gods, yet also their own.'
3232:So what are you to do now?
3233:Why did they do it?
3234:'Once you ssecure thiss gate, you will become sstronger, and you will remember what your god needss from you. And I will ansswer more questionss.'
3235:You see a strong group trying to push past a dark barrier. The barrier is weakening -- there are several holes already, and some sviatelko are getting through and helping from the inside.
3236:'Nyia'ss path to divinity wass not an easy one. Shamed for siding with darkness a long time ago. Plagued by misguided followerss who defiled our laws in her name...{}{}{}{}And yet, with Morena gone and Veles too, she did not cower from her duty, nor whine about past wrongs. Many fear her and with good reason. Within her hollowed heart, you must ignite a spark or she will never truly wake. To do this, you must travel to the lands of Metal or the grim wastelands of Darkness.'
3237:'The world wass ssung into being by giantss of old. Their ssong wass of balance, but it gave birth to the child of darknesss and the child of light. The two ssiblings would be locked in conflict. People ssay that I, zmey, am the child of darknesss, but I am not, merely a lessser avatar at besst. Veless carriess the name of the child too, but he too iss but a reflection. To battle the child of light sseeking to escape, Veless ssplit his power to create the domainss of Magic and Intellect and gifted it to the other godss.{}{}{}{}But now. Sso many questions. Answers come after.'
3238:You find the place where you are supposed to find Perun's rod. It is a large mound with what looks like a tall, overgrown tree with no branches and oddly, there is no ice or snow here.{}{}{}{}This could be the rod you are searching for.
3239:Try to remove some of the moss and dirt to check.
3240:It takes a while to remove the debris, built up over decades or perhaps much longer. But when you step back, you see that the mound is shaped like a giant stone hand, and it does hold a lightning rod.
3241:Try to remove the rod.
3242:[Zerca or wisdom]Take a closer look and consider your knowledge.
3243:[Dwarf or elf]Your people have the knowledge of the ages. Examine this site carefully.
3244:[Mroki]This seems familiar. Look closely.
3245:You recall tales of the return of the giants back in the days of the Awakening. These ancient creatures of the earth woke from their slumber and threatened to destroy the land. Eventually, they were put back to sleep. You also know they play a vital role in the natural balance of things, even when they sleep.
3246:Force it out by breaking the rock.
3247:[Tools and craftsman]Try to pull it out without breaking the rock.
3248:Leave it for now.
3249:This must be the hand of a giant. These ancient shepherds of the earth keep this land alive with their life-song, even as they now slumber. There was a time during the Awakening when giants returned. Perhaps this one fell to its sleep slowly and thus was able to safeguard the rod for Perun.{}{}{}{}Or he could have been made to hold this rod by magic, by whomever wanted it trapped. In any case, one must be very careful when dealing with giants, even the sleeping ones.
3250:[Dwarf female]Sing the dwarven life-song. After all, it was given to the dwarves by the giants.
3251:[Dwarf]Whisper to the stone and ask the giant to let go, as you are both stonekin.
3252:[Elf]Use your natural connection to magic to speak to the giant and ask it to give you the rod.
3253:This one is one of your kin, as you once were when giants returned during the Awakening. But while most were lulled into deep slumber, you were taken by darkness wholly and transformed into what you are now. {}{}{}{}This brother of yours is sleeping, but he was clearly asked to hold this rod, and even in his slumber, it will be hard to break it away from him.
3254:Seep into the stone as black mist and speak to your brother so that he might release this object for you.
3255:You work to uncover more of the rod and the rock that holds it, but every time you try to pull it out, you feel a push back from the stone hand, as if some natural reflex is holding on to it.
3256:You force the rod out by breaking the stone hand, but as you do, the crushed rock assembles as a rock troll and attacks you!
3257:You crush the troll-like creature and the debris collects itself and forms back into a stone hand, this time empty.
3258:Take the rod.
3259:You hold up the rod. The skies crack open and fire bright lightning that blinds you.{}{}{}{}A thundering voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'Finally! The seal is broken. It is time for the young gods to remember and for their chosen to grow. Now, bow before my power and accept the divine gift.'{}{}
3260:Accept the gift of Turmoil, the domain of warriors and those who favour change.
3261:Take the blessings of Light, the force for direct action and patron of crafts.
3262:'I am the voice of Perun, the father of the skies. I am here to tell you what your next steps will be. Whom do you serve, child?'
3263:Ask why he has abandoned the pantheon.
3264:Zorya.
3265:Triglav.
3266:Svarog.
3267:Stribog.
3268:'The skies cannot remain still; the thunder does not linger. We were needed, so we left. The skies, the earth, and the underworld, the power of three as one to hold the earth in our grasp and allow our children to stand strong. I was made divine to stand for Light, and thus my power was needed to keep it at bay. But you will know all once your divine memory is restored. Now, whom do you serve, child?'
3269:'The fiery daughter of the stars, yes. I gifted her Turmoil, for she is forever torn by the conflict of her many natures.{}{}{}{}Zorya's natures need to be united so that she and you may become more. Go to the lands of her chosen children, the volcanic wastelands where she is called Zorza and hailed supreme. The daughter of Svarog has never suffered from humility...'{}{}{}{}The voice fades, and when your eyesight is restored, the giant hand holds the rod again.
3270:'Interesting. The unstoppable wrath of the pantheon. A force of nature drawn from the depths of earth's fire to face the other core that slept near it.{}{}{}{}You must travel into the volcanic lands, made so by your very birth. Or should I say the birth of your god? I forget myself. Good luck to you, chosen of the fire.'{}{}{}{}The voice fades, and when your eyesight is restored, the giant hand holds the rod again.
3271:The power of Turmoil lies in its unexpected nature, the ever-changing conflict of light and darkness. {}{}{}{}As such, you are marked as demon, a creature equally steeped in chaos.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3272:Ask who you should speak to.
3273:You are badly beaten and the rock troll-like creature disassembles and rebuilds itself back into the stone hand holding the rod. {}{}
3274:The power of Turmoil lies in its unexpected nature, the ever-changing conflict of light and darkness. {}{}{}{}As such, you are marked as unliving, a creature equally steeped in chaos.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3275:The power of Turmoil lies in its unexpected nature, the ever-changing conflict of light and darkness. {}{}{}{}As such, you are marked with the power to fight and a companion to aid you.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3276:The power of Light has many faces, but one of its key aspects is sustaining the fires that keep your homes safe and power the furnaces of craftsmen across Thea.{}{}{}{}As such, you are now marked as craftsman and gifted with skill and the tools to use it.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3277:The power of Light has many faces, but one of its key aspects is sustaining the fires that keep your homes safe and power the furnaces of craftsmen across Thea.{}{}{}{}As such, your skill is increased and you are gifted with the tools to create divine objects and a companion to aid you.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3278:You crush the stone hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3279:You try to force the rod out by breaking the stone hand, but as you do, the hand stretches out and slaps you down, forcing you to flee.
3280:You safely remove the rod from the stone hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3281:Your song echoes into the earth as only a dwarven tale can, and the stone responds and opens its palm for you. You safely remove the rod from the stone hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3282:The old giant listens to your whispers and heeds your plea. The hand opens and you safely remove the rod from the stone hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3283:The stone does not heed your whispers, which saddens your heart greatly.
3284:You find the sleeping soul of your brother and it listens to your plea, despite your fall to darkness. The stone responds and opens its palm for you. You safely remove the rod from the stone hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3285:'Ah, the most steadfast of our sons. I gifted him with both Turmoil and Light, for he is the shield of the pantheon and must stand ready.{}{}{}{}You must travel to the lands of metal and stone. There you will find my son's divine forge and, within it, the answers you seek.'{}{}{}{}The voice fades, and when your eyesight is restored, the giant hand holds the rod again.
3286:'When our land broke and water filled the gaps, it was Mokosh who elevated Stribog to take up the mantle of the great guide. But it was I who gave him the domain of light, so he may find his true path even in darkness.{}{}{}{}The answers you seek are elusive, so you must search for them while you travel on the seas of Thea.'{}{}{}{}The voice fades, and when your eyesight is restored, the giant hand holds the rod again.
3287:Accept the gift of Turmoil.
3288:Take the blessings of Light.
3289:'The skies cannot remain still; the thunder does not linger. We were needed, so we left. The skies, the earth, and the underworld, the power of three as one to hold the earth in our grasp and allow our children to stand strong. But you will know all once your divine memory is restored. Now, whom do you serve, child?'
3290:'The fiery daughter of the stars, yes. I gifted her Turmoil, for she is forever torn by the conflict of her many natures.{}{}{}{}Zorya's natures need to be united so that she and you may become more. Go to the lands of her chosen children, the volcanic wastelands where she is called Zorza and hailed supreme. The daughter of Svarog has never suffered from humility...{}{}{}{}The voice fades, and when your eyesight is restored, the giant hand holds the rod again.
3291:The power of Light has many faces, but one of its key aspects is sustaining the fires that keep your homes safe and power the furnaces of craftsmen across Thea.{}{}{}{}As such, your skill is increased, and you are gifted with the tools to create divine objects and a companion to aid you.{}{}{}{}'Good, you are becoming more like yourself!'
3292:Your song echoes into the earth as only a dwarven tale can, and the stone responds and opens its palm for you. You safely remove the rod from the hand and feel the ground tremble, but the rod is free and the tremors pass.
3293:You are drawn to the site of another one of Mokosh's roots. This one is not assailed by light, but it is a mere tree stump that seems barely alive.{}{}{}{}And yet, despite its sorry state, you feel an immense power calling out to you. 
3294:[Forest folk]Examine the tree and speak to the other plants here. Perhaps they know more.
3295:[Zerca]If this is indeed a divine place, one should expect that an offering is needed. Move in closer to analyse this place.
3296:The echoes of the old forest that once grew here whisper of the sister-tree, a creature later called goddess and now forgotten. {}{}{}{}They tell you this root goes deep, deep into the earth, but something from within it is burning it up. It requires energy to stay alive. But you also see a leshy observing you.
3297:Give a generous offering of cooked food.
3298:Offer the entire spirit essence of one of your own kin.
3299:Sacrifice the life of some pets to honour the gods.
3300:Give one life - a true sacrifice.
3301:Convince him that you are chosen and you are here to help, but he needs to tell you how.
3302:Face the leshy in the spirit world to convince him that your spirit is bound to the gods.
3303:You slaughter the leshy and see the tree stump turn black and wither away. {}{}{}{}It looks like whatever your gods wanted you to do is lost to you.{}{}{}{}As the place turns barren and the leshy's remains turn to ash, you are able to absorb some of the lingering energy.
3304:You go in closer to search for clues when you notice a leshy watching you.
3305:Speak to the leshy. Ask them what this place is.
3306:The leshy remains silent, but continues to watch you intensely.
3307:The leshy nods and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Yes, the offering of your food is adequate to strengthen the sister-tree's essence, so we may keep the wretched light away. You, little chosen, must make more haste, make them go back into the earth...'{}{}
3308:Tell him you have defeated the light-beast already.
3309:Is the sister-tree Mokosh, and if so, why?
3310:If you must make haste, what is the next step?
3311:'Oh, splendid. This will make life easier, or harder, but still it is splendid.{}{}{}{}But this is not why you come here?'
3312:'You are here and you made an offering to the sister-tree, so you may now receive the gifts of your domain. Stand still.'{}{}{}{}The leshy stretches out his branches and you feel divine grace surround you.
3313:Accept the blessing of Nature.
3314:Accept the blessing of Harmony.
3315:'The tree is that which you call the cosmic tree, an ancient leshy, of sorts - the root of life, some say. {}{}{}{}Mokosh is a sapling that grew out of it, but different. She is like us, but not like us. She is sister-tree to us. She is the mother of your gods, but as many mothers must, she had to leave so her children could grow.'
3316:Why did she have to leave, and why does no one remember her?
3317:'Some remember still. But your gods exist only when they are worshipped, for without that, they lose their divinity. {}{}{}{}Mokosh, her chosen mate, Perun, and of their first sons Veles created divine domains and split them between all gods. This was to ensure greater stability, but it required a sacrifice. {}{}{}{}And then there was the earth's Shattering, of course.'
3318:What of the Shattering?
3319:'Light escaped and it wants to come out entirely. The underworlds will be purged, the earth scorched, and the heavens blasted away - and so, the three stand guard until you make your choices, or until it all fails.{}{}{}{}Now, this talk costs me too much energy. We must proceed with your task at hand.'
3320:What is the next step?
3321:The leshy looks at you but does not move. The air around you becomes thick. It is likely this offering offended the goddess.
3322:Leave for now.
3323:The leshy nods and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Yes, your offering is strong, it will serve well to strengthen the sister-tree's essence, so we may keep the wretched light away. You, little chosen, must make more haste, make them go back into the earth...'{}{}
3324:The leshy nods and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ah, the ultimate offering of a life. This will indeed be enough to strengthen the sister-tree's essence, so we may keep the wretched light away. You, little chosen, must make more haste, make them go back into the earth...'{}{}
3325:The leshy nods and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Ah, the ultimate offering of a life. This will indeed be enough to strengthen the sister-tree's essence, so we may keep the wretched light away. It is not a gift expected of one that seeks harmony, but perhaps that makes it a stronger offering.{}{}{}{}You, little chosen, must make more haste, make them go back into the earth...'{}{}
3326:The leshy looks at you and remains silent, but you feel his judgment upon your bloody actions. {}{}{}{}You feel your divine soul burn from this.
3327:You come closer and examine the tree. You see places where there were clearly offerings placed for the goddess Mokosh. {}{}{}{}But you also see a leshy observing you, and you suspect he acts as a guardian here, judging your actions on behalf of the goddess.
3328:The leshy is still watching you.
3329:The power of Nature flows through you and calls to your inner beast. {}{}{}{}Your vitality grows and you feel strengthened throughout. A fellow beast also joins your pack.
3330:Thank the leshy and ask if this is all you were supposed to do.
3331:The leshy defeats you, and surprisingly, it does not seem hostile beyond defending itself. {}{}{}{}You feel a flow of negative energy from the tree trunk, though. It seems that whatever god essence resides here, it was not impressed with you.
3332:'That choice is always yours, but there is a final stage of your journey, one that will lead you to your divine patron and thus unlock both of your potentials further.{}{}{}{}Which deity do you call to?'
3333:Dievanna.
3334:Horz.
3335:Nyia.
3336:Lada.
3337:The power of Nature flows through you and calls to your inner beast, and even though you remain yourself, other animals will consider you kin.{}{}{}{}Your vitality grows and you feel strengthened throughout. 
3338:The power of Harmony calls to you and commends your calling as a healer. {}{}{}{}Your vitality grows and you feel strengthened throughout. A cmuch joins you so that you may work together to improve people's health.
3339:The power of Harmony calls to you and grants you the gift of healing. {}{}{}{}You also feel your vitality improved and your intellect strengthened.
3340:'A true daughter of Harmony and Nature - on one hand fierce and wild, on the other soothing and calm. {}{}{}{}Dievanna is a daughter of Veles, from before he was divine. She was called upon to ascend when her father had to leave, and it was Mokosh who gifted her with her domains and trusted the young goddess to keep watch over the forests.{}{}{}{}Seek out your final path in the ancient forest, among the feral packs that call Dievanna their master.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3341:'Yes, the beast master. His creatures are those of the night, the moon children, and yet they remain part of Nature also. Horz, master of the moon, who clawed his way into the pantheon to impress his love. {}{}{}{}Seek out the metallic lands or the volcanic fields where the night beasts dwell, hiding from those who forever seek to destroy them. Follow the moon and you will find the light you seek.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3342:'Hmm. Your master's mind is one and three, and thus it cannot remember itself. They rose when the need was great and brute force was required. Triglav is the hammer of the gods.{}{}{}{}But despite their fiery exterior and brutish stance, there is more to Triglav than meets the eye. Seek out their birthplace in the black ash and red lava of the volcanic lands.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3343:'Ah, the lady of death exemplifies Nature well, does she not? A troubled soul if ever there was one among the divine. Once a servant of death, now its divine mistress. Can you imagine the loneliness of such a hated role?{}{}{}{}Within her hollowed heart, you must ignite a spark or she will never truly wake. To do this, you must travel to the lands of metal or the grim wastelands of Darkness.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3344:'The child of hope born in our darkest hour, how has she grown. Once she was the youngest deity, unsure of her place. Now she stands at the helm, keeping her siblings in check with love and a firm hand when needed.{}{}{}{}To follow the path of Lada, you must go to the land least touched by her warmth - the ice lands - or the ancient forest, where her charm has always been worshipped. There you will face your final task.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3345:'You are here. You serve the sister-tree's children and your words are wise, so you may now receive the gifts of your domain. Stand still.'{}{}{}{}The leshy stretches out his branches and you feel divine grace surround you.
3346:Accept the blessing of Nature, the force that favours balance and accepts the wheel of fate.
3347:Accept the blessing of Harmony, the domain that stands for stability and peace.
3348:Why is this goddess relevant to your path? Why does light seek to harm her?
3349:'You are here. You serve the sister-tree's children and your spirit is strong, so you may now receive the gifts of your domain. Stand still.'{}{}{}{}The leshy stretches out his branches and you feel divine grace surround you.
3350:'Mokosh is the earth mother of your gods. She is so because she stands for balance. You see, it was the giants who first sang the world into being - at least this world - and their song was in equal measure light and dark. But then the song created the child of light and the child of darkness, siblings that would be forever locked in conflict. Mokosh stands guard for balance, and her destruction would free the children.'
3351:But isn't she gone? She is not one of your gods, after all.
3352:'She is forgotten for now, but not gone, never gone. Her roots are deep and hold the earth. You asked before why this old goddess is connected to you. She is connected to all the gods, and thus also to their chosen. Now, time is running out.'{}{}{}{}The leshy stretches out his branches and you feel divine grace surround you.
3353:'Ah, the wild child of the sea and the winds, yes. Although the life-giving force of water remains Mokosh's domain, they needed a child of the seas, a true traveller for this new era.{}{}{}{}The answers you seek are elusive, so you must search for them while you travel on the seas of Thea.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3354:'Yes, the beast master. His creatures are those of the night, the moon children and yet they remain part of Nature also. Horz, master of the moon who clawed his way into the pantheon to impress his love. {}{}{}{}Seek out the metallic lands or the volcanic fields where the night beasts dwell, hiding from those who forever seek to destroy them. Follow the moon and you will find the light you seek.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3355:'The child of hope born in our darkest hour, how she has grown. Once she was the youngest deity, unsure of her place. Now she stands at the helm, keeping her siblings in check with love and a firm hand when needed.{}{}{}{}To follow the path of Lada, you must go to the land least touched by her warmth - the ice lands - or the ancient forest, where her charm has always been worshipped. There you will face your final task.'{}{}{}{}The leshy does not wait for a reply, but goes back into slumber.
3356:As you wander the lands of metal and stone, you feel drawn into an abandoned forge. {}{}
3357:The forge is much larger on the inside than you would expect, but it is oddly empty, with only a single massive furnace and one central anvil, both clearly made for creatures larger than humans, larger even than most trolls you've seen.{}{}{}{}You recognise the sigil of Svarog upon the anvil.
3358:Speak up and ask your god for guidance.
3359:You see a faint glimmer of fire in the furnace, and from it forms the figure of an old smith with a great golden beard. He looks at you, his eyes glazing as he frowns. You know him to be Svarog, yet you also feel he is lost. When he speaks, you feel the wrath of his voice:{}{}{}{}'Do I know you?'
3360:'Hmm. You bow as if I should be your lord? Am I? {}{}{}{}It is cold here, so cold. My fires have gone out and that beast there holds the flame and refuses to give it to me...I cannot seem to focus on anything else...'
3361:Tell Svarog you will aid him!
3362:'Hmm. Your odd defiance suggests that I am someone to you. Am I? {}{}{}{}It is cold here, so cold. My fires have gone out and that beast there holds the flame and refuses to give it to me...I cannot seem to focus on anything else...'
3363:Say that you can take a look.
3364:You walk over to a dragon. It looks at you, bored, and opens its jaws to show you that it holds a golden flame in its mouth.{}{}{}{}You see that only the chosen can move. All others stand frozen in awe of the golden beast.
3365:[Chosen only]Turmoil boils in your blood and calls for bold action. Reach in for the flame, enduring any pain that may come with it.
3366:[Chosen only]Attack!
3367:[Chosen only]Light calls to you, and you know what must be done. Reach for the light with your spirit.
3368:'The fire burns and so does my heart. I will reforge my mind now so I may serve again. And you - you did well in following my path, I see. You honour craft, value wisdom, or befriend the great dwarven kin. This is wise.{}{}{}{}I see now that I must strengthen my calling as a craftsman and remember my roots to help forge a better future. Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3369:'When the three elder gods decided to create divine domains, they took power from all of us. I suspect this had its side effects.{}{}{}{}Turmoil and Light come from my father, but he needed to feed off my mastery of the sun to achieve this. I suspect this weakened me for a time. I was once the god of sun. When the light escaped its confines, I was most drawn to it. I suspect my loss of power was necessary, so that I did not fall.'
3370:'No, a part of each lived on and was reforged as the god you know as Triglav -- the three as one, forged in fire to aid us in this hour of need.'
3371:So they needed power from each of the other gods to create domains, but why the need to take memories?
3372:'They were our leaders, our strongest, my parents and sibling. I do not question why - clearly it was needed to complete their work, for otherwise they would have left the mantle of leadership to me.{}{}{}{}It was surely deemed safest that we do not know until our chosen are strong enough to unlock the truth.'{}{}{}{}You sense the slightest tinge of resentment in his booming voice.
3373:'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Svarog turns away and slowly turns into pure sunlight and disappears.  You are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3374:As you walk away, you feel your fate improved also.{}{}{}{}[As part of your final gift, you will gain a small chance of an unusual class choice when your  child grows up.]
3375:'The fire burns and so does my heart. I will reforge my mind now so I may serve again. And you, you clearly favour Turmoil in your path, as you did not always follow my lead in your choices. Thus, I shall need to strengthen my divine presence, perhaps look to the sun again, not the mundane. Yes. Good.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3376:'I chose to follow balance and the divine calling, and not dwell on mortal attachments.{}{}{}{}You gave me clarity, chosen. I now understand the sacrifices made by the older gods and what we, those chosen to remain, must do.'
3377: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Svarog turns away and slowly turns into pure sunlight and disappears.  You are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3378:Choose Turmoil and thus increase the chances of your children growing into bandits.
3379:Choose Light and thus make the children who grow up into crafters stronger.
3380:'I am the son of Perun and Mokosh. I did not choose - I accepted with honour my duties as a divine son.'
3381:'It is neither bad nor good, just like its sibling, darkness. They are both driven to obey their nature.{}{}{}{}You see, at first, there was balance as the two coexisted. But the child of darkness cannot stand still. They changed the world, they made new races -- orcs, who sought to conquer, and goblins, who mastered the spirit realms.'{}{}
3382:You endure the process well and stand before your god proudly as you retrieve the flame.{}{}{}{}You take it back to Svarog. He looks at you with a renewed sparkle in his eye as he takes the flame and lights the furnace:{}{}{}{}'A bold move indeed! Well done, my chosen. You have restored us.'
3383:You barely endure the process and your spirit is heavily assailed. But you retrieve the flame. {}{}{}{}You take it back to Svarog. He looks at you with a renewed sparkle in his eye as he takes the flame and lights the furnace:{}{}{}{}'A bold move indeed! Well done, my chosen. You have restored us.'
3384:You kill the dragon and take the flame back to Svarog. He looks at you with a renewed sparkle in his eye as he takes the flame and lights the furnace:{}{}{}{}'A bold move indeed! Well done, my chosen. You have restored us.'
3385:So it worked?
3386:The dragon devours one of you, but then relinquishes the flame to you before flying away with a mischievous smile.{}{}{}{}You take the flame back to Svarog. He looks at you with a renewed sparkle in his eye as he takes the flame and lights the furnace:{}{}{}{}'A bold move indeed! Well done, my chosen. You have restored us.'{}{}
3387:As you wander the lands, you feel a sudden call toward a lake. There, you witness a celebration of water demons, but you also sense they are not merely dancing, but worshipping Lada.{}{}
3388:Go in closer to greet them in the name of Lada.
3389:One of the rusalka turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, chosen, we danced and danced and waited for you to arrive. You must be here to enter the lake and see our Lady's reflection in it. But to do so, you must pass through us, of course. Choose your path wisely.'{}{}{}{}She blows you a kiss and continues dancing.
3390:You sense the lake is filled with the essence of your goddess, and you know you must approach, but the water demons stand in your way.{}{}
3391:[Male Chosen]Try to seduce the rusalka so she will let you pass.
3392:[Female Chosen]A vodnik is also dancing here. Seduce the king of the lake to let you pass.
3393:[Any Chosen]A befuddler also stands guard by the lake. Seduce him, as he is less picky than his elders.
3394:'I sense you have walked my path well, and I feel the calling of my true nature beaming from you. You have favoured intellect in your folk, nurtured beauty, or appreciated the healing power, or perhaps you are exceptionally fertile. Regardless, you have chosen the path for me well.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3395:What does it mean that she chose this path? Were there others?
3396:Why did she lose her memory in the first place? 
3397:Why and how did she become a god?
3398:'When the three elder gods decided to create divine domains, they took power from all of us. I suspect this had its side effects.{}{}{}{}This light that now troubles our land speaks loudly of harmony and reason. It tries to lure beings such as myself to its side. Perhaps I needed to forget for a time, so that I shall not be tempted to lie in wait until a chosen comes and becomes my instrument in the mortal realms. Yes.'
3399:'Did they take our memories, or did we lose them as our strength wavered? Or did we simply forget you, for it was not yet time for us to know you? They needed to take our power, and we gave it freely, but nothing comes without a price. There is no happiness without sorrow, my chosen child.'
3400: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Lada's enchanting vice sweetens the air as she walks off, leaving you alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3401:As you walk away, you feel your fate improved also.{}{}{}{}[As part of your final gift, you will gain a small chance of an unusual class choice when your child grows up.]
3402:'Yes, you have given me the spark of joy back, even though I sense you have not always walked my path well. But this only means I must renew my confidence as the divine, and perhaps worry less about the frivolity of my nature. You have given me a clear path. This is good.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3403:Choose Intellect and thus increase the chances of your children growing to be zerca.
3404:Choose Harmony and thus make a child that becomes a healer stronger.
3405:'I came to life when the cosmic tree burnt long ago. My divine origin left no space for choice - that is often a luxury reserved for mortals, one they oft fail to appreciate...'
3406:The water demon smiles and accepts your advances. You join the fertility celebration and feel the energy around the lake grow. The water on the lake ripples with every dance step until you see the reflection of Lada appear and speak to you:{}{}{}{}'You have awakened me, Chosen, and given me energy. I see my faith in you was wise.'
3407:Bow before the goddess.
3408:The water demon does not respond, so there is some awkwardness. You feel drained from the attempts, but eventually they do allow you to join the fertility celebration, and then you feel the energy around the lake grow. The water on the lake ripples with every dance step until you see the reflection of Lada appear and speak to you:{}{}{}{}'You have awakened me, Chosen, and given me energy. I see my faith in you was wise.'
3409:You kill the water demons, and the water on the lake ripples as if tears were dropping down on it. You see the reflection of Lada looking at you:{}{}{}{}'You chose violence when violence was pointless. You defiled my worshippers with your dirty blades, and now my power will be locked, for you are not the chosen I had hoped for. Go forth and redeem yourself, but know that you will not receive my final blessing.'{}{}{}{}The lake is still and empty, as is your soul...{}{}
3410:As you wander the lands, you find a small grove and feel the pull of your divine connection. {}{}{}{}You see a pack of Dievanna feral roaming freely. One of them stands out - taller, faster, beaming with divine presence. When she turns to you, you feel it is somehow your goddess.{}{}
3411:Go in closer and try to speak to her.
3412:As you approach, the other feral steps forwards and the goddess steps away. One of the feral speaks, their voice crooked, rusty, as if human speech has become strange to it:{}{}{}{}'You leave, we free, we smell Her on you so you no food, but go.'
3413:Tell them you are here to talk to Dievanna.
3414:You see a faint glimmer of recognition in your goddess's eyes as you speak her name, but then she looks to her pack as if it were up to them to allow you to approach, even though she is clearly the strongest here.{}{}
3415:[Chosen only]Speak to the feral calmly to convince them you are Dievanna's chosen, and as such, you mean no harm.
3416:[Chosen only]Walk forth with your spirit exposed to show them that you too are a child of Nature.
3417:[Beast Chosen only]Give in to your bestial nature and show the feral that you are their kin as well as Dievanna's chosen.
3418:[Druid Chosen only]Speak to the feral in Elvish and remind them of their roots. Then assert that you are Dievanna's chosen, so there is kinship between you.
3419:'So, you followed my path thus far. Respected the laws of the forest, perhaps befriended some of my creatures, or chose harmony over violence when possible. Good. Long have I said one must follow one's instinct, and this I shall choose as divine also. {}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3420:'I did not. I was busy and I waited for you to grow. When the three gods gave us domains, it also drained our power. For some it made them confused, lost, and for others we went quiet to regain composure.{}{}{}{}This light that now troubles our land is unnatural, unbalanced - it promises harmony but lies. Harmony can only come from the coexistence of the two forces, not the dominance of one. But while we waited for our tools to grow, I had to protect the forests from the scourge.'
3421:'And so, the three were free to forge their domains and grant them back to us, so we may face this new threat and others that will surely come.{}{}{}{}Their true essence was of course not lost. It is what held the world intact, despite the continuous tremors.'
3422:Will they return?
3423:'I do not have such answers, but in a way, perhaps they never left, simply becoming more -- as is often the way with the greatest of us.'
3424:So why was it necessary to wait for a chosen?
3425:'It has always been the primal law that we cannot directly act in the mortal realms. Sometimes we are able to send down avatars with limited power and awareness of their divine purpose. But those are very costly. {}{}{}{}The chosen are a less reliable route, for you so often act according to whim and gain. Still, you are what we need and what we are allowed to have. Simple.'
3426: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}You turn for a second and you no longer see Dievanna, only the forest and so you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3427:'I see you have struggled to follow my path with clarity, but you also have passed all the tests given to you and arrived here. This tells me it is time for me to choose the divine path and shed my primal nature, at least for now.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3428:Choose Nature and thus increase the chance for forest demons when you allow fate to guide your child, and increase the chance for a druid elf.
3429:'Veles chose a dark path away from his origins. Mokosh grew stronger as the maker, and was unable to stay close to the woodlands. The new gods are needed and the forest needed one, so I shed my elven past, just as Veles once did, and I chose to join the children of the cosmic tree.'
3430:So are the three gods gone for good?
3431:The feral growl and snarl at you, but eventually they yield and recognise your kinship to their master. Dievanna nods, her eyes becoming instantly as sharp as a hawk's as she stares straight into yours:{}{}{}{}'You passed, good. I was wondering how long it would take you to arrive. Now, time for me to leave this pack.'
3432:The feral growl and snarl at you and refuse to back down. You persist, and eventually you see Dievanna nod at her pack to let you pass, but as chosen, you feel your spirit drained.{}{}{}{}'You are not as strong as the forest demands! Still, let us hope you have time to remedy this before all is lost. Now, time for me to leave this pack.'
3433:You kill the ferals and you feel the forest watching you and a wild voice speaks:{}{}{}{}'You chose to destroy my children for the sake of violence, not life. You defiled nature and ignored harmony. You are not the chosen I had hoped for. Go forth and redeem yourself, but know that you will not receive my final blessing.' {}{}{}{}The forest remains shaken, but you hear no more voices.{}{}
3434:You kill the ferals, although not without heavy losses and you feel the forest watching you and a wild voice speaks:{}{}{}{}'You chose to destroy my children for the sake of violence, not life. You defiled nature and ignored harmony. You are not the chosen I had hoped for. Go forth and redeem yourself, but know that you will not receive my final blessing.'{}{}
3435:Your ship is caught in a great storm that threatens to drown you, but from within the chaos you hear the quiet but strong guiding voice of your master.{}{}
3436:Listen to Stribog and follow his voice.
3437:Great waves carry you forward, and you soon realise one of them is your god. The divine wave is wild and magnificent, but you feel it is lost in its elemental fury.
3438:The skies clear and the waves calm, but the wind remains strong as it answers:{}{}{}{}'Do I know you?'
3439:'You bow before my power, yes? Or was there more... should I know you?{}{}{}{}Sometimes I am the wind, sometimes the waves on the sea. So many call for my guidance, but why do they call? This siren sings so constantly, her voice so loud that I cannot bear to hear anything else...'
3440:Tell Stribog that you will aid him!
3441:'Your tone suggests that you know me. Or was there more... should I know you?{}{}{}{}Sometimes I am the wind, sometimes the waves on the sea. So many call for my guidance, but why do they call? This siren sings so constantly, her voice so loud that I cannot bear to hear anything else...'
3442:Only now do you begin to hear the terrible song of a czytlica sitting on a rock nearby. {}{}{}{}You see she is chained to this rock; her eyes are swollen with tears, her lips and skin dried from being unable to swim. But she sings on, and all but you, the chosen, are entranced by the song. 
3443:[Chosen only]It is Harmony that calms the wild seas, and so to harmony you must call now. Sing your own song to try to soothe the czytlica and break whatever bond holds her.
3444:'The song is finally quiet, so I can hear the wind and the sea again. You carried my will well so far, followed my nature in your choices, and so I must choose this path too. Together we will restore the land and guide the lost into the true light of the pantheon, not the terror of the blindness that descends.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3445:'When the three elder gods decided to create divine domains, they took power from all of us, before they could give it back. {}{}{}{}Weakened, a creature of Light and Harmony such as myself would be more vulnerable to the call of this new force that tries to break us. We needed time to become ourselves again, time for our champions to rise. I gave the czytlica power to hold me with their song for this reason.'{}{}
3446:'I do not believe we all lost our memory, but I think each one of us was depleted of power and, as such, we turn to our instinctual forms or scatter as avatars. Each has their own way. In short, it is only the part that has contact with you that was ever 'lost' while the true divine essence continues to work elsewhere.{}{}{}{}We cannot act physically in the mortal realm - such is the law. Thus, this path was needed for you to walk it and become more.'
3447: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}You hear Stribog's voice become wind as  you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3448:'The song is finally quiet, so I can hear the wind and the sea again. I see you were not always able to follow my path while I was deafened, so I must refocus on my divine duties, stand above the past and stay steadfast. {}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3449:'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils to deal with in our realms.'{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}You hear Stribog's voice become wind as  you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3450:'I do not recall the why or when. I was a spirit of the wind, a traveller of the seas. When the world was sunk, I became more. Mokosh called to me as earth mother, Perun commanded me as master of the heavens, and thus I became Stribog.'
3451:The czytlica looks at you, her eyes wide in joy as her chains break and she is able to dive into the sea. Stribog's form grows and you feel a divine beam of power:{}{}{}{}'Freed at last! And you released that poor creature I was forced to enslave here. Well done.'
3452:You barely endure as the czytlica song tries to take your very soul in the depths of the seas. You are exhausted, but something finally shifts and the czytlica looks at you, her eyes wide in joy as her chains break and she is able to dive into the sea. Stribog's form grows and you feel a divine beam of power:{}{}{}{}'Freed at last! And you released that poor creature I was forced to enslave here. Well done.'
3453:You strike down the czytlica and see relief in her eyes as her body slides into the water. Stribog's form grows and you feel a divine beam of power:{}{}{}{}'Freed at last! And you released that poor creature I was forced to enslave here. Even Harmony knows that sometimes death is the greatest peace. Well done.'
3454:You barely endure as the czytlica song tries to take your very soul in the depths of the seas and her claws rip into you. You are exhausted, but something finally shifts and the czytlica looks at you, her eyes wide in joy as her chains break and she is able to dive into the sea. Stribog's form grows and you feel a divine beam of power:{}{}{}{}'Freed at last! And you released that poor creature I was forced to enslave here. Well done.'{}{}
3455:As you travel the volcanic wastelands, you come across many lava pits, but you are drawn to one in particular. It looks ordinary for this place, with scorching heat and bubbling, red-hot plasma puffing out black ash. {}{}{}{}But the longer you stand here, the more you're certain that this is where Triglav was born.
3456:Approach.
3457:When you reach the edge of the pit, you realise that the bubbling and the ash are a result of many light creatures swarming inside the lava, trying to infiltrate it and dying in the process, yet ever more rising up to continue the assault.
3458:You see three faces form in the pit and look back at you:{}{}{}{}'Do I know you?'
3459:'Hmm, you bow. It feels right that you should, little ant. We are great and your reverence wakes a distant memory in us. {}{}{}{}These lights are constantly blinding my sight. Destroy them so that I may deal with you.'
3460:Agree to help if you can.
3461:A spit of hot lava hits your face and the three voices boom at you:{}{}{}{}'Impudent little ant, who are you to demand anything of us? Your arrogance wakes a distant memory. You are a part of me, yes - an annoying wart I discarded, maybe?{}{}{}{}These lights are constantly blinding my sight. Destroy them so that I may deal with you!'
3462:The longer you stare at the pit, the more you feel the lightbringers' odd pull and soon you notice that only you, the chosen, remain in control of your body and will. The others stand entranced.{}{}
3463:[Chosen only]Walk into the lava, endure its heat, and allow your lord to take your strength to destroy the light!
3464:[Chosen only]These creatures have a strong mystical presence. Show them the power of a chosen's spirit!
3465:'Ah, you got rid of the pests that were distracting us. You walk the path of fire well, yes. Warriors, strong folk, the metal-forged dwarves, or the fierce orc kind, you embrace them, good! Now we are clear in our purpose again. Now I can choose to battle as my primal self.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3466:'We are three - three natures forged as one. With your choices, I can focus on the primal aspect for which I was called into being. This will affect you and me. But for better or worse? We will see. {}{}{}{}You gave me clarity, chosen. I now understand the sacrifices made by the older gods.'
3467:'Lost? We are many. We share glimpses of those who gave us life, but we have no memories beyond when we rose from the lava and fought. We remember calling you to be our chosen, and we know we must battle. {}{}{}{}But through you and your journey here, something deep inside now stirs. Memories? Or mere imprints? Three beings needed more power, three beings gave theirs away, out of the three became the divine domains and more - us?'{}{}
3468:'The three, they each laid down their divine life to achieve their goals, so now we all share in their power.{}{}{}{}Their true essence was of course not lost. It is what held the world intact, despite the continuous tremors.'
3469:Why was this knowledge of the three gods so hidden, then?
3470:So they are the three gods?
3471:'Birthing a god is no small feat. I am born of need, or rage, or power. But I am still young. I feel them inside me, yet I do not. My future is unclear to me, and so is my past.{}{}{}{}You assume I stand here before you? I do not, we do not. We are in many places now, and then, and later. We fight in realms you cannot know, but in this one, we are not allowed to. Only you can.'
3472:'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Your god melts back into the lava and you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3473:'Yes, we are released. But we sense our trifold nature was not always clear for you to follow. This means we must choose to feed the divine nature of our calling, calm the fires somewhat so that our call will become clearer. Good.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3474:'We chose to follow balance and the divine calling, not dwell on the ever-fierce battle within our trifold nature.{}{}{}{}You gave me clarity, chosen. We now understand the sacrifices made by the older gods and what we, those chosen to remain, must do.'
3475:As you walk away, you feel your fate improved also.{}{}[As part of your final gift, you may choose one more bonus in accordance with your god's domains. This bonus will apply for children growing up.]
3476:'There was no choice, only destiny. The three needed me as the earth shattered, and I am made of the earth's core, so I hold it together while we all fight. My fire is fuelled by the light, so it cannot stop me easily.'
3477:'It is neither bad nor good, just like its sibling, darkness. They are both driven to obey their nature.{}{}{}{}You see, at first, there was balance as the two coexisted. But the child of darkness cannot stand still. They changed the world, they made new races -orcs, who sought to conquer, and goblins, who mastered the spirit realms.'{}{}
3478:You walk into the lava and endure its burning touch. Just as you think that your body will succumb and melt away, you feel the protective embrace of your lord and you see the lightbringers perish. Triglav rises from the pit and places you on the ground:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes! Destroy them all - this is what we were born for. You did well to come here and aid me, though no aid was needed, of course. Still, we are freed!'{}{}
3479:You barely endure the excruciating pain as the scorching lava boils your flesh, while the lightbringers blind all your senses but pain. Just as you think that your body will succumb and melt away, you feel the protective embrace of your lord and you see the lightbringers perish. Triglav rises from the pit and places you on the ground:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes! Destroy them all - this is what we were born for. You did well to come here and aid me, though no aid was needed, of course. Still, we are freed!'
3480:You destroy the lightbringers, and the lava pit briefly calms down, before erupting in a blast of magma that forms into Triglav:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes! Destroy them all - this is what we were born for. You did well to come here and aid me, though no aid was needed, of course. Still, we are freed!'
3481:You fail and are drawn into the lava. You barely endure the excruciating pain as the scorching lava boils your flesh, while the lightbringers blind all your senses but pain. Just as you think that your body will succumb and melt away, you feel the protective embrace of your lord and you see the lightbringers perish. Triglav rises from the pit and places you on the ground:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes! Destroy them all - this is what we were born for. You did well to come here and aid me, though no aid was needed, of course. Still, we are freed!'{}{}
3482:'I am Perun, Mokosh, and Veles, yes, and I am Triglav, yes. I... I am rage and power and need incarnate!'
3483:The moon turns blood red, and you hear the howling call of your lord. You sense the presence of other creatures of the night, congregating.{}{}
3484:Follow the call.
3485:You see a coterie of strigas standing guard over a magnificent sleeping wolf. A striga master and striga mistress both hold a liver chain that is wrapped around the divine body of the wolf.{}{}They turn and watch you, but say nothing.{}{}
3486:The wolf does not wake, but you feel the warmth of his breath, hear the slow beating of his heart, and sense his soul reaching for the moon, yet unable to do so in his slumber.{}{}{}{}You realise now that all but you, the chosen, stand entranced by the beautiful beast.{}{}
3487:[Male Chosen only]Impress the striga mistress and implore her to release your master, for you are children of the moon!
3488:[Female Chosen only]Demand the striga master yield to your words and recognise your kinship under the moon!
3489:[Chosen only]Walk forth as chosen with your spirit exposed, and trust in the path of Horz!
3490:'You walk the path of the moon well. You honour night beasts by accepting them in your pack, or you value the importance of a keen eye. Good. I thus choose to let loose my primal nature, so we may both serve the moon.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3491:Why did he lose  their memory in the first place? 
3492:'I recall agreeing to let the elder three borrow the moon's power through me, so that the earth would not shatter further.{}{}{}{}This light that now troubles our land is unnatural. It is not moon, nor the stars that shine brightest, nor even the ever-pompous sun. So, we all needed to change to fight it.{}{}{}{}I am the moon and the moon is me. For the three to take my power, I had to sleep, so my children kept me safe while I awaited you.'
3493:'We are god, but we remain bound by cosmic laws - more so than mortals, some would say. We cannot act directly in your mortal realms; thus, we needed our chosen to rise, survive, and find their way here. Through the journey you gained strength, yes? And so, what we intended is done, even without you facing me now.'
3494: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}You hear the final howl of Horz and kneel in its glory, before you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3495:'You struggle to follow the moon path, no? I sense that you have not always been led by my domains, but perhaps that is exactly what is needed of a chosen - their own path. Still, I must now focus on the divine calling, for my primal sleep clearly left my voice wakened. {}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3496:'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}You hear the final howl of Horz and kneel in its glory, before you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3497:Choose Magic and thus increase the chances of your children growing into witches and shamans.
3498:'I was a beast of the night once, a night lord still, but not divine. Then I looked up into the stars and my soul was bound to them forever. But my beloved's father would not allow an inferior mate, so I had to become more, become equal so she would claim me as hers!'
3499:The strigas yield to your command and recognise your kinship to the moon. The chains are released, and the night lord rises to howl to the moon. He then turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Many moons passed before you came, but you have proven that you are a child of the night, so I am free to sing to the moon and run with the stars! Good.'
3500:Bow before the night lord.
3501:The strigas feel your weakness and drain your spirit, but they taste Horz in your blood, so they eventually yield. The chains are released, and the night lord rises to howl to the moon. He then turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Many moons passed before you came, but you have proven that you are a child of the night, so I am free to sing to the moon and run with the stars! Good.'
3502:The striga resists your attack and dominates you instead. You cower before her mesmerising power and you know you are not the worthy alpha your lord deserves.{}{}{}{}You will not gain your final reward, instead you must spend your days seeking redemption.{}{}
3503:As you travel the lands, you are drawn to a particular place, guided by a star. {}{}{}{}When you come closer, you see three human women standing together silently. One is young, tall and muscular, her eyes wild with fire, her features almost orcish. One is much older, grey-haired but no less athletic, with garb more like that of a sage, and her eyes glazed with the purple light of magic. The final one is middle-aged and she looks weakened, barely standing, her body tearing itself in two. {}{}
3504:Approach. 
3505:Several orc bloodtrackers stand in your way:{}{}{}{}'Halt, if you wish to live!'{}{}
3506:Speak up and ask Zorya for guidance.
3507:A matriarch steps out of the shadows:{}{}{}{}'You are Zorza's pup, I smell it. You best not interfere. We long yearned for her to become truly of Turmoil, and look, the weakling sides are losing. Soon Zorza will be the warrior she is meant to be!'{}{}{}{}You see fire in the matriarch's eyes, and you notice that all your people but you, the chosen, have been taken aside by the orcs. No one but the matriarch stands in your way.{}{}
3508:[Chosen only]Agree with the matriarch and watch what becomes of Zorya.
3509:[Werewolf Chosen only]Howl at the moon and stars, and remind Zorya of her life mate, Horz, so that he may guide her back to you.
3510:[Chosen only]Demand that she stand aside. You are chosen, and you will not allow this!
3511:'You walk my path well. You respect the raw potential of the Turmoil children, orcs, you value strength and the path of the warrior, and you made choices to act swiftly and without mercy when it mattered. Good. I can pursue my primal nature with a chosen who knows their place well.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3512:'My father Svarog spoke to me when he felt the corruption of light spreading. I allowed my stars to serve his will, and from what I now sense, he gave this power to the three elders so they may build the domain. {}{}{}{}This light that now troubles our land, it would have struck hard, and I would refuse anything but a frontal assault. My father knows me well indeed. And so, without my full strength, I was fragmented, a piece of me given to you. It needed to find its way back to me, and now it has.'
3513:'And so, with all our powers given freely, the three were free to forge their domains and grant them back to us, so that we may face this new threat and others that will surely come.{}{}{}{}Their true essence was of course not lost. It is what held the world intact, despite the continuous tremors.'
3514: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Zorya's light washes over you and blasts into the sky. You are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3515:'You did well to come here, but I sense that Turmoil has muddled your path to me, and you were not always following my call. I must then reinforce my divine self, so that we both may walk the stars with certainty. Good.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3516:'I am daughter of Svarog, and his fires burn true in me from the moment of my inception till all the stars fade away. There was never any other way.'
3517:The matriarch yields to your superiority and steps aside. As soon as you approach, the three women stretch out their hands and touch you, and as they do, they merge into one:{}{}{}{}'You were not swayed by the brute beliefs of my servant. Good. Although fire burned in her young heart, she did not understand our divine role. I am not, nor was I ever, two or three - they are merely my aspects, and I need all to remain myself.'
3518:The matriarch does not yield and seeks to stop you, but the three women reach out and take your spirit. Then they all turn to the rebellious matriarch, who cowers before their gaze.{}{}{}{}'You were not swayed by the brute beliefs of my servant. Good. Although fire burned in her young heart, she did not understand our divine role. I am not, nor was I ever, two or three - they are merely my aspects, and I need all to remain myself.'
3519:You hear the scream of all three women. The middle one is torn in two, the older one withers away, and the young one turns to flame and perishes. {}{}{}{}Deathly silence falls upon you, and as you glance at the matriarch, she lies dead, her body burned from the inside.{}{}{}{}You still feel your connection to Zorya - she is not gone - but you also know that you have failed your final task and will not receive any last blessings.
3520:The three women turn to you one by one, and their eyes begin to flicker with starlight. You hear an overwhelmingly powerful howl answer yours, and it is that voice that truly shakes the ground. The orc matriarch drops to her knees under the pressure, and the three females fuse, become Zorya, and shout back to the moon in greeting. She then turns to you:{}{}{}{}'You walk the path of my mate. Wonderful! You did well to free me thusly, for he will always know me truly, so I could find myself following his voice.'{}{}
3521:As you travel the lands, you find yourself lost in an eerie, dark place filled with shadows, dim lights, and odd whispers surrounding you.{}{}{}{}As you move forward, you see a perfectly round hole that reeks of emptiness. Several spirits are half submerged in it, desperately trying to get out. {}{}
3522:As you get near the hole, you feel the presence of Nyia calling out from the chasm, unable to reach you. {}{}
3523:Call out to your goddess, and try to aid her with your spirit.
3524:You feel her awareness rise, but she is still unable to reach you, while the spirits become more restless and try to rip themselves out of their trap. You feel their efforts are hurting the goddess.{}{}{}{}You also notice that everyone but you, the chosen, has become entranced and unable to act.{}{}
3525:[Spirit Chosen only]Commune with your kin and move past them to reach your goddess.
3526:[Chosen only]Unbind these wraiths with your spirit.
3527:[Chosen only]Through the sheer power of your mind, push past the spirits so that the goddess may reach you!
3528:'My path is ever a mystery to me, so I am surprised to feel that you tried following it so well. You favoured mystical arts or destiny and embraced the cursed unliving, despite their unnatural state. After all, if I cannot pity them, who will? I thus choose to explore that path more now.{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3529:'Lose my memories? Were they ever truly found, or did I have them in the first place? I dwell in places dark and lonely - I dwelt there now before you came. Was this by some design, or just my nature? {}{}{}{}This light that now troubles our land, the others said it must be stopped, that power must be given for new power to be born. I understood this, so I agreed. Then it was dark, until you came.'
3530:'From what I sense, the older gods, the three - they created the domains. I was given three to carry, of course... but maybe I deserve that. They gave their divine being for this. Interesting.{}{}{}{}Their true essence was of course not lost. It is what held the world intact, despite the continuous tremors.'
3531: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Nyia's body becomes shrouded in dark mist as she walks off and you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3532:'My path is forever shrouded in mystery, even for me. Death is a certainty, yet is not for me, so what is certain - nothing? But I accepted this burden, so I will try to find my divine calling, so that our destiny may become clear to us, chosen. This is good, perhaps...{}{}{}{}Now, speak your questions, my champion, for we do not have much time here.'
3533:'I was goddess once, then I was not. I served Veles and Morena, then I did not. My wheel is complicated. I chose the wrong side once and was banished, but then the sides shifted again, and now I am here. Death must be, so I am.'
3534:Your will is strong, so you are able to push past the ghosts and reach your goddess in the dark pit. She rises and looks at you with sorrowful eyes:{}{}{}{}'A tiny spark in the sea of darkness - how odd you are, my chosen. You are part of me, but a part I never know why I made, or when. Still, you coming here must have meaning, so we must rise together. Good, maybe...'
3535:The spirits fight you with all they have, and this drains your soul greatly. As your will fails, you see the world change again, and you no longer stand by the black pit. You know that you have failed your goddess and you will have to prove your worth using the gifts you already received on this journey.
3536:You destroy the ghostly figures and the barrier that stood between you and Nyia drops so you can reach your goddess in the dark pit. She rises and looks at you with sorrowful eyes:{}{}{}{}'A tiny spark in the sea of darkness - how odd you are, my chosen. You are part of me, but a part I never know why I made, or when. Still, you coming here must have meaning, so we must rise together. Good, maybe...'{}{}{}{}
3537:You can still pull away. Retreat and return when you are truly ready!
3538:This is the path of Marovit. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3539:You can still break away. Retreat and return when you are truly ready!
3540: 'Now you and me both, we are free. I shall resume my divine duties in full, as whatever your choices may yet be, there are ever greater perils in our realms.{}{}{}{}My last blessing to you may reveal itself when one of your children turns adult. But as I see, your path here has already unlocked your might, so go forth, my chosen, and choose your path in my name.'{}{}{}{}Marovit walks away into the greyworld and you are left alone, with a last gift placed at your feet.
3541:This is the path of Svarog. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3542:This is the path of Lada. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3543:This is the path of Dievanna. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3544:This is the path of Horz. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3545:This is the path of Nyia. You can only enter with the chosen who begun this journey.
3546:The crow shrugs (as much as is possible), but says nothing.
3547:'Good trading with ya. May your fires never die.'
3548:'Welcome, what ya looking for, laddies?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}This village is small, as such, it will not offer recruitment and may have other options limited.{}{}
3549:Ask if you can buy some trained bears from them.
3550:Ask if you can visit the ancient forge they have here.
3551:'You're no friends of ours, so you best move along or you will taste our blades, mate.'{}{}{}{}You see armed dwarves gathering.
3552:Say that you mean them no harm. You just want to talk and visit.
3553:'Say, we do have us a wee problem, yes. Our men keep going off to this one rock and they never return. I sent several patrols already, but none have come back. We're small, so we don't have more to spare. Please, can you go check?'
3554:'Sure, come, sit and drink bimber moonshine. {}{}{}{}If yer in luck, a healer may take a look at yer wounds.'
3555:Ask if there's a runemaster who can heal spiritual ailments.
3556:An old dwarf sits and shares dwarven moonshine with whoever wants to listen to his tall tales. Join him.
3557:Ask if a fellow runemaster is present to aid you with healing spirit wounds.
3558:'Aye, you want to prove your mantle to us, eh? Well, we did spot an orc band roaming not too far from here. We ain't sure what they're up to, but we'd rather they be up to it somewhere else. You get my meaning?'
3559:'Help, eh? Sure, why not.'
3560:Ask if there is any trouble in the area they need help with.
3561:You suspect they are in need of gemstones. Say that you're willing to give away some of yours.
3562:'Damned bandits are botherin' our folk again. We're small, so I don't have the men to spare. Ya wanna be friendly with us, go deal with the ruffians!'
3563:'Us dwarves, we do not play well with magic. Our runemasters are rare, and they can only heal the spirit of our own kind.'
3564:[Dwarf]Ask for the healing.
3565:Nod in understanding.
3566:'Aye, yer godly folk, that much is clear. Our thanks to ya, friend.{}{}{}{}We cannot give much, but here, have what we can spare.'
3567:'Aye, we do have some good animals you can buy, but they ain't cheap.' 
3568:Buy a bear. 
3569:'We have a simple task for ya, if yer really honest 'bout that friendship with us. We're short on manpower and we need someone to clear some tunnel for us. Go there, and make sure my men can go in and dig safely.' 
3570:'Bah, ya talk a good talk. Come in, but we're watching ya!'
3571:'Beat it, or ya'll regret ever comin' this way!'
3572:The runemaster comes out carrying a heavy metal-bound book and many vials. He gestures towards a chair:{}{}{}{}'Sit, brother. I will cleanse your stone spirit of any impurities, be they curse or ailment.'{}{}
3573:'Ya can go see it, but the old forge master is a whimsical type, so ya best be on guard and behave. Not every mark of respect gets accepted.'
3574:[Nature]Nature and fire do not mix too well. You feel constrained within these hot, dusty walls. Nevertheless, offer a blessing of the wild.
3575:[Harmony]Harmony has no affinity for the heat of battle or the art of smithing. In fact, this is where weapons are made. Still, offer a blessing.
3576:[Light]Call upon the power of the light to pay tribute to this place of your worship.
3577:[Intellect]The forge masters and rune keepers are known to have sharp minds. Bow in honour of their vast knowledge.
3578:[Magic]Dwarves are not attuned to the weaves of magic, yet their runemasters found a way to carve mystical force into stone and metal. Meditate and leave a blessing of your domain for their runemaster.
3579:[Turmoil]This is where true blades are made. Call out to turmoil in a battlecry to honour this sacred place!
3580:Keep your distance and admire the site from afar before leaving.
3581:'Either we do not have any work for you, or you or your kin are already set on a path to aid us, so finish that before you ask for new tasks.'
3582:'Ah, as you know, brother, us dwarves, we do not play well with magic, and our trade as runemasters is rare. We can only heal the spirit of our own kind. {}{}{}{}But since you are here, this will go easy.'
3583:'We don't have any of those wise arses to talk to ya, make ya feel all good inside. But we do have good spirits, warm food, and tales of good times past. {}{}{}{}No guarantees, but we ain't chargin' for it either.'
3584:Give it a go.
3585:Your mind is a little rested, but the food and drink made you sick too.
3586:'Ya best run before we kill ya all!'{}{}{}{}The dwarves take your goods and watch you run.
3587:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'What ya doing!? My forge is no place for plant-lovin' folk spreadin' words of fluffiness. Go away!'
3588:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'What ya doing!? My forge is no place for peace-lovin' folk spreadin' words of fluffiness. Go away!'
3589:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, children of light, good. Yer blessin' is well received. May the fires never die for ya!'
3590:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, children of turmoil, good. Yer blessin' is well received. May the fires never die for ya!'
3591:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'The path of wisdom -- rarely do folk see it in my work. I thank ya. May the fires never die for ya!'
3592:The forge master's voice booms at you:{}{}{}{}'Ya keep yer magic away from my forge, ya hear? But no curses, right? Just leave.'
3593:'Welcome, what ya looking for, laddies?'{}{}{}{}Some village activities will only be available when you are friends with its people and some are restricted to chance, so coming back from time to time may be worth it.{}{}{}{}Once you become friends, you will get the chance to recruit.
3594:See if you can recruit someone.
3595:'Yer no friends of ours, so ya best move along, or ya will taste our blades, lassies.'{}{}{}{}You see armed dwarves gathering.
3596:'Aye, we do have a wee problem. Some armoured bears escaped our handlers. Nasty beasties, they are. We ain't thinking to have them back, at least not easily, but see if ya can do anythin' about them, eh?'
3597:You see they are in need of gemstones. Say that you're willing to give away some of yours.
3598:Ask if there is anything causing them trouble in the area?
3599:Ask if there are any places of interest around here.
3600:'Now, you may be just the laddies we need. There's an ancient forge that belongs to us, but something claimed it and warded it against dwarf kind, so now we can't enter. The bloody cheek of it! Go find out who did this and kill the bugger!'
3601:'Typically, we don't like strangers poking around on our land. But I guess ya earnt the right. {}{}{}{}There's plenty of old ruins and places we ain't had a chance to scout, so knock yourself out.'
3602:'Us and rock trolls, we have a complicated relationship. We're often friendly-like, but ya know, not always. A couple of big bastards set up camp in a ruin we want to explore, and they bloody ate our patrol! Now, we'd go see why they're being dicks like that, but we ain't got the manpower. Ya go check for us, eh?'
3603:'We killed a bunch of orcs a while back -- it'd be a century almost, now. Lately those buggers've come back to life and keep botherin' our patrols. We ain't got time to kill the same enemy twice. Ya wanna be our mates, ya go do it.'
3604:We don't have any of those wise arses to talk to ya, make ya feel all good inside. But we do have good spirits, warm food, and tales of good times past. {}{}{}{}No guarantees, but we ain't chargin' for it either.'
3605:You find the lone rock upon which the syrin have nested. Even from afar you hear their sweet song and just as the dwarves said, it is hard to resist. 
3606:[Demon]These demon tricks do not work on you. Approach the syrin.
3607:[Female]The syrin lure males, but your own senses remain strong. Sneak in closer to have a better look at the syrin.
3608:[Rusalka]Ah, those syrin are known for their screechy voices, but so are you. Sing your own tune and see who is better.
3609:Approach carefully.
3610:You come up to the rock and see the syrin, a bird-like demonette, smiling at you:{}{}{}{}'Oh, demon kind, how swell. Come to hear my song? My usual audience has gone deaf . . .'{}{}{}{}She gestures towards a couple of stone dwarven statues standing nearby, posed in admiration of the syrin. You also spot movement in the shadows. There may be more than one syrin here.
3611:Ask if those are the missing dwarves. What did she do to them?
3612:You go in determined to stay alert, but the song is so sweetly sorrowful . . .
3613:Fight it!
3614:For a short time, the song is entirely entrancing and drains your spirit, but you overcome it. 
3615:Stay focused and approach the syrin.
3616:You are entranced, and some dwarven women have to come rescue you from the clutches of the syrin. They are unimpressed with your 'help.'
3617:'Yes, perhaps you are right. Perhaps a price for our loss has been paid by those who stand here. Their stone faces will pay tribute to our fallen sister-mother. We will leave now.' 
3618:Report back to the dwarves. 
3619:Your sorrowful song carries over the hills and mountains, and soon many dwarves, even those far away, turn to stone. {}{}{}{}When your sorrow is satisfied, you and your sisters part ways.
3620:The syrin are unmoved and their song becomes ever louder, threatening to reach the dwarven village soon.
3621:'Do? Nothing, as such. Dwarves are made of stone at heart. My song broke their heart, and thus to stone they turned in their sorrow. Hardly my fault.'
3622:Ask her to stop singing. Enough dwarves have lost their lives.
3623:[Syrin or alkhonost]Ask your sisters why they sing the mourning song here.
3624:[Demon]Demons are bound by the laws of fate. Invoke demon laws to play a game of chance. If they lose, they have to leave. If they win, you pay with your own spirit.
3625:The dwarves are enraged by your dishonour in changing sides and killing their brothers. You lose much of their respect. 
3626:The dwarves appreciate that you got rid of the syrin, but they would have preferred to avenge their fallen brothers, so your friendship grows only a little.{}{}
3627:The dwarves appreciate that you got rid of the syrin, and even though they would have preferred to avenge their brothers, they recognise that this is a win.{}{}{}{}They leave a reward for your good deeds and offer food and ale to celebrate.
3628:Thank them, partake in the drinking, and leave.
3629:When you inform the dwarves of your failure, they are disappointed in your efforts. 
3630:You defeat the syrin and their damned song. {}{}{}{}The dwarves are pleased that you avenged their brothers' death. They leave a reward for your good deeds and offer food and ale to celebrate.
3631:'We lost our sister-mother. She died, struck by a dwarven hammer. They did not mean it. She was sick and attacked them. Yet our sorrow remains, and they need to pay.'
3632:Agree and join your syrin sisters in the mourning song, for losing a sister-mother is the gravest of losses for your kind.
3633:You come up to the rock and see the syrin, a bird-like demonette, smiling at you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, the fairer sex. I suppose at least with you I can speak -- not like them.'{}{}{}{}She gestures towards a couple of stone dwarven statues standing nearby, posed in admiration of the syrin. You also spot movement in the shadows. There may be more than one syrin here.
3634:Chance did not favour you. The syrin win and take your spirit. They also remain to taunt the dwarves.
3635:The syrin fly down from the rock and join you in your song:{}{}{}{}'Bravo, sisters, bravo! Our tune was in mourning for our sister-mother, slain by the dwarves. But your valiant melody cast away our melancholy. We will leave this place be. May the gods of song stay with you.'
3636:Thank them and report your success to the dwarves.
3637:You come up to the rock and see the syrin, a bird-like demonette, smiling at you:{}{}{}{}'I like you. You hear my song, yet you remain strong -- not like them.'{}{}{}{}She gestures towards a couple of stone dwarven statues standing nearby, posed in admiration of the syrin. You also spot movement in the shadows. There may be more than one syrin here.
3638:You defeat the syrin and their damned song, and they fly away in a panic.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are pleased that you avenged their brothers' death in a way. They leave a reward for your good deeds and offer food and ale to celebrate.
3639:You come across the place where bandits were spotted in the past.{}{}You see some signs of humanoid presence, but all the signs are old.
3640:[Hunter or perception]Track the bandits.
3641:Look for the bandits.
3642:You sneak up on the bandits and see that they are a diverse bunch. They are celebrating their latest job. This may be a good time to get rid of them.
3643:Surround them and make your presence known.
3644:You are ambushed by the bandits!
3645:You search the place and finally spot some bandits. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
3646:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to bring a message that they need to leave, as the dwarves do not want them here.
3647:[Bandit]Tell them the dwarves are getting ready to move in hard on them. Say that you'll pay them a bit, and that way they can leave while keeping their thief honour in place.
3648:[Attractive]Flaunt your booty and say that surely a deal can be made for them to leave.
3649:You are badly beaten and the dwarves have to come to your rescue. They are unimpressed with your 'help.'{}{}
3650:'Well, I guess we can be convinced, but if you pay a smaller fee, we can go and even do some trading. What do you say?'
3651:Agree, trade.
3652:'Blah, blah, blah. Gods have mercy on us if you're their person. Just leave us be and we ain't gonna beat ya. Go.'
3653:Offer to pay them 40 credits to leave.
3654:The bandits rise and grab their weapons:{}{}{}{}'What ya want here? Need us to whoop your arse or somethin'?'
3655:Threaten the bandits and say that even if they beat you, the dwarves will be next to come, and they will knock the life out of them!
3656:The dwarves are unhappy that you let criminals go free. They have to go find them now, and that is not what they asked for.{}{}
3657:The dwarves are impressed with how quickly you got rid of the troublemakers, although they are not entirely happy that criminals got off scot-free. {}{}{}{}Still, your friendship grows.
3658:When you inform the dwarves of your failure, they are disappointed in your incompetence. 
3659:You kill all the bandits.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
3660:'Bah, why not. Them dwarves are not easy when they get real angry. Time to move on.'{}{}
3661:Trade with them and leave.
3662:'What, no tradin'? In that case, we stay.'
3663:Offer to pay them 400 credits to leave.
3664:The bandits keep to their word and move out. 
3665:Report your success.
3666:The bandits rise and grab their weapons:{}{}{}{}'What are you yammering about? You think just 'cause we're bandits we always go for pretty faces? Beat it!'{}{}{}{}You hear faint whispers of 'Glad the captain isn't here, else their trick would've worked.'
3667:You find the place where the dwarves sent you to get rid of some orcs.
3668:[Hunter or perception]Track the orcs.
3669:You see the orcs licking their wounds after a battle with a rock troll that now lies dead at their feet. {}{}{}{}Luckily for you, there seem to be only a few with weapons at the ready.
3670:Surround the orcs and make your presence known.
3671:You are ambushed by the orcs!
3672:You search the place and finally spot some orcs. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
3673:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to tell them they need to leave, as the dwarves do not want them causing trouble here.
3674:Orcs respect strength. Show your power and convince them to leave this place before the dwarves come.
3675:[Orc]Praise the clan for their victory over the troll. Say that the puny dwarves see them as a threat, so they sent you to do their job.
3676:'Ha! Of course they see us as a threat, and so they should, the rock heads. I look forward to the day we can meet in honourable battle. {}{}{}{}Still, we are no raiding party. We're bloodtrackers, here to get a trophy, and we got it. We need to heal up now and rest. Then we move out. I give my honour-word we will not bother the stone town.'
3677:[Healer or cmuch]Offer them help in healing.
3678:Nod and say that you will carry the message to the dwarves. Wish them good enemies and sharp blades on their way home.
3679:Insist that they depart within a day. 
3680:You stay for some time and help the orcs heal. {}{}{}{}'Zorza smile on you and make your blades sharp, friends. We go now. You tell the shorties they are safe, ha ha!'
3681:'We have wounded warriors, so we ain't moving. You face us with swords, or you go!'
3682:The matriarch stands tall and speaks:{}{}'Halt! Come no further or meet the fate of this troll. We may look battered to you, but we are orc, and we will fight to the death!'
3683:Admit that you were sent here by the dwarves, who are concerned about orc activity so close to the settlement.
3684:'So this is what my word means to you and those shorties, eh? You may be worthless scum, but I am a woman of my word. I said we did not come here to make trouble with the dwarves, and I meant it. We go. But you best hope we do not meet again, scum.'
3685:Report back to the dwarves.
3686:The dwarves admire your lawful ways:{}{}{}{}'Aye, laddies, good on ya. The orcs not only were wounded but also gave their word, so it was wise to give them aid. Even if they are stinking dogs.' {}{}
3687:You stay a while to help out, then leave to report back.{}{}{}{}'Zorza smile on you and make your blades sharp, friends. We go now. You tell the shorties they are safe, ha ha!'
3688:The dwarves look angry:{}{}{}{}'She gave her honour-word and ya chased her away? With wounded warriors who had just battled a troll? Where's your honour, lassie?'{}{}{}{}Your friendship does not grow.
3689:The dwarves look angry:{}{}{}{}'She gave her honour-word and ya chased her away? With wounded warriors who had just battled a troll? Where's your honour, lassie?'{}{}{}{}Your friendship does not grow, but they pay you for the job, as agreed.
3690:You kill all the orcs.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are pleased with your help and offer a small reward.
3691:'So this is what my word means to you and those shorties, eh? You may be worthless scum, but I am a woman of my word. I said we did not come here to make trouble with the dwarves, and I meant it. So either you face us in battle, or we stay to heal!'{}{}
3692:'What, those rock heads can't deal with their own shit now? Or do they mean to disrespect us by sending you lot?'
3693:[Dwarf]How dare they accuse your kin of such petty games? State clearly that this is what you say it is: a polite request for them to move away from this land.
3694:Say that dwarves are not known for playing such games. They just want the orcs gone from their territory.
3695:You kill all the orcs and report back. But the dwarves are very angry!{}{}{}{}'They gave you their honour-word, they were wounded, and you killed them in our name! You lassies have no pride. Ya best leave us now.'
3696:You approach the area where the pack of armoured bears the dwarves lost is now roaming free and wreaking havoc. 
3697:You know how to handle bears. Try to figure it out.
3698:[Hunter]Track the bears.
3699:[Nature or Intellect]Use your mental prowess to figure out what to do. 
3700:[Bear]Dominate the bears.
3701:Use your own food to lure these animals away from the territory and hope they won't come back.
3702:[Orc]Bear wrestling time!
3703:You get in closer and observe several armoured bears roaming the place angrily.
3704:[Dwarf]Your kin lost control of them, but your folks trained bears for a living. Try to lead them back to the dwarves.
3705:You have those who can communicate with bears. Make the beasts obey you.
3706:Bears respect territory. Try to figure out a way to mark this land for the dwarves, thus making the bears leave.
3707:[Hunter]Set a trap for the pack and attack when they are weakened.
3708:Stalk the bears and pick them off one by one, making the rest flee.{}{}
3709:You wrestle the alpha bear and break its neck with your bare hands, and the others submit to your dominance. {}{}{}{}The bears even return to the dwarves, who are impressed with your skill.{}{}
3710:One of the wounded bears lashes out at you in a dying frenzy.{}{}
3711:Put them down.
3712:You mark the territory and harass the pack until they move on.{}{}{}{}You got rid of the problem as you were asked, so the dwarves are grateful.{}{} 
3713:You got rid of the problem and the dwarves are pleased.{}{}
3714:You gave the food away and led the animals to another spot. 
3715:'Bah, ya feed the beasties, lassie, they'll come for more. Foolish.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves are not impressed.
3716:You got rid of the bears, and the dwarves are happy with your work. {}{}
3717:You got rid of the problem as you were asked, and your friendship will surely grow.{}{}
3718:You are unconvincing, and the beasts stay.
3719:Your scheming fails, and you are assailed by the bears.{}{}{}{}The dwarves hear your screams and come to your aid. They have to kill the bears themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
3720:The bears bow to your dominance and agree to go back to the dwarves. Perhaps one even decides to stay with you.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are very happy with your work.{}{}
3721:The dwarves are unimpressed with your failure. They have to kill the bears themselves and are angry at having to spare the time. You do not gain any friendship.
3722:The bear wrestling goes badly, and the dwarves laugh their arses off at your failure. They leave you some jewellery, saying that lasses look good in trinkets.{}{}{}{}You gain some friendship only through your shame.{}{}
3723:You approach the bears and remain as calm as stone as you mount one of them and ride out its rage. The others bow to your dominance, and all go back to the dwarves.{}{}{}{}The earthbound are very pleased with your work and reward you for it.{}{}
3724:You find the cave where the dwarves asked you to check on some rock trolls.
3725:[Hunter or perception]Track the trolls.
3726:You see one or more trolls and several rockers huddled over something and arguing:{}{}{}{}'How long yet?'{}{}'Loong, quiet.'{}{}'We go now? We go?'{}{}'No!'{}{}
3727:Approach the troll and ask what all the commotion is about.
3728:You are ambushed by the trolls!
3729:You search the place and finally spot some trolls. Alas, they spot you too, so you haven't got much time to decide what to do.
3730:Stop, throw up your hands, and say that you do not wish to fight, just to tell them they need to leave, as the dwarves do not want them here.
3731:[Dwarf]An awakening of the wee ones! Tell the trolls that you are honoured to be here and witness it.
3732:'We do not go, we have young that wait to be awakened. If we go now, they die. Why you listen to little stone people? Why they want us go? We only eat them ones that come and poke us!'
3733:[Magic user]Offer to help them awaken their young with a ritual, then they can leave without further delay.
3734:Say that they do not need to leave. You will explain their situation to the dwarves.
3735:Offer to give them lots of food. You heard that helps trolls grow, so maybe it will help with the little ones.
3736:You stay for some time and help the trolls with the ritual to awaken the rockers. {}{}{}{}When the time comes, the trolls keep you at bay, so you still don't know exactly how little trolls hatch, only that it requires magic and the presence of the adults. {}{}{}{}They take the young, leave you a reward, and slowly move away.
3737:'You little people, you go, you tell little stone people we go when we want to go.'
3738:They turn to you and you notice a skshack sitting quietly in the middle of all the rocks. The poppa troll speaks:{}{}{}{}'Whaat you want here, little one? You come to help?'
3739:[Nature]As trolls are creatures of nature's will, proclaim it is your domain and thus they must leave.
3740:Say that the dwarves heard odd noises and had people disappear here, so they asked you to get rid of the trolls.
3741:'Sensitive time now, we not need the little stone folk troubling us, so we go. But we are not happy, you tell them that.'
3742:Report to the dwarves.
3743:The dwarves say that it is a joyous event for rockers to awaken, and they are pleased that you helped. Your friendship grows.
3744:The trolls look at you and nod:{}{}{}{}'Yes, little people, you go, you tell little stone people we go when we want to go.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves say that it is a joyous event for rockers to awaken, and they are pleased that you did not interfere. Your friendship grows.
3745:The dwarves are furious that you interrupted a sacred rite of the trolls:{}{}{}{}'Bad luck, lassies, bad luck for us all!'
3746:The dwarves are furious that you interrupted a sacred rite of the trolls:{}{}{}{}'Bad luck, lassies, bad luck for us all! But maybe we should have told ya, aye. You best go now.'{}{}
3747:When you inform the dwarves of your failure, they are disappointed with your efforts.
3748:You kill the trolls, and the dwarves praise you for your courage:{}{}{}{}'Rock trolls are made of the same mould as us, so they're tough nuggets to crack. Well done, ya! Those ones were up to somethin' odd, and we had no time to deal with it.'{}{}{}{}They leave a reward for you.
3749:'Little stone people know us well. You can stay, you keep quiet. They be easy to break now.'
3750:[Dwarven female]Offer to sing the earth song, a lullaby you would sing to your own stone younglings.
3751:You are fast on your feet and have good wits about you, so jump away and run to safety.
3752:'Say, if you're not fighting us, give us food, and we go away!'{}{}
3753:Agree to give them food.
3754:You give the trolls food. They take it and huddle over their little rocks again, not allowing you to see anything.{}{}{}{}Soon, you hear tiny voices. The trolls take the young and slowly move away.
3755:You stay and sing the earth song to the rockers, and soon enough you feel their life slowly waking. {}{}{}{}When the time comes, the trolls keep you at bay, so you still don't know exactly how little trolls hatch, but it must be a lot like your own young.{}{}{}{}They take the young, leave you a reward, and slowly move away.
3756:When you inform the dwarves of your failure, they are distraught that you tried to interfere with a rocker awakening. {}{}{}{}Your friendship suffers for it.
3757:You kill the trolls, but when you report back to the dwarves, they are distraught that you interfered with a rocker awakening, saying that it was a sacred rite. {}{}{}{}'Shame on ya, shame on ya, lassies!'
3758:You give away your food, but the trolls only pretend to leave. In fact, they settle even closer to the dwarves and cause much trouble.{}{}{}{}The earthbound dwarves are not impressed with your efforts, saying that you should never feed trolls, as they just come back for more!
3759:The earthbound dwarves are not impressed with your efforts, saying that you should never feed trolls, as they just come back for more. But they admit that, this time, the trolls seem to be gone for now. So they will pay you for your efforts.
3760:An armed group of dwarves stands before you.
3761:Try to convince them you are friendly.
3762:'Ah, good day to you, friends, well met.'
3763:'Fine, fine, here, you take your bounty, we back away. No need for fightin' and no hard feelings either, eh?'
3764:Your words don't work. You are beaten and chased away.
3765:'Perhaps ya ain't the enemy. Ya pay us, we put in a good word with our kin.'
3766:Agree to pay.
3767:Say you do not need their good word, bid them farewell.
3768:'Ya spoke well, so begone.'
3769:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, which loses you some respect from your enemy.
3770:You find the old cave that the dwarves asked you to clear for them.
3771:Start clearing the west tunnels.
3772:Begin with the south tunnels.
3773:The west tunnels are largely uninhabited, so there are no dangers here. But there is a lot of rubble that needs clearing before the dwarves can begin any real work.
3774:[Dwarf]You've done this as a youngster many times, so you know the safest and quickest way to get the job done. Do it.
3775:[Craft and tools]Construct some equipment first to increase your efficiency.
3776:[Karakandza]Digging tunnels is what you do, so tell the others to stand aside and clear this place yourself.
3777:[Elf]Digging up rubble, really? No. 
3778:You channel your demon nature, and within mere hours the tunnel is clear.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are truly impressed with your work.
3779:The dwarves find a gold vein when they dig deeper in your tunnel, so they are very thankful for your hard work. {}{}{}{}They reward you well and your friendship grows. 
3780:You dig and dig and dig till you think it's never-ending. It is tedious and wears on your morale, and it ends with a dangerous collapse of an arch that nearly kills you.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are not impressed with your incompetence.
3781:The dwarves find a mithril vein when they dig deeper in your tunnel, so they are very thankful for your hard work. {}{}{}{}They reward you well and your friendship grows. 
3782:You dig and dig and dig till you think it's never-ending. But eventually the tunnels are clear.{}{}{}{}All the other tunnels prove to be dead ends. It is tedious and wears on your morale. 
3783:'Oh, you arrogant pointy ears! You're all lassies, that's what you are. Go play in the forest.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves are not impressed with your incompetence.
3784:The south tunnels lead deep underground, and you soon come to a chamber where you spot a striga master standing still as stone, but unnervingly observing your every move. 
3785:[Magic user]Prepare a ritual and face the master in the spirit world.
3786:[Striga master or mistress]Demand that they leave this place, now!
3787:Abandon the tunnels.
3788:The striga master falls and you are able to clear the rest of this cave without further dangers.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are happy with your results and reward you well.
3789:The striga master feeds on you before you manage to escape. The dwarves are not impressed with your incompetence.
3790:One of you wakes the next night as a creature of the moon!
3791:The dwarves are grateful for your quick intervention. They reward you well and your friendship grows. 
3792:You leave the tunnels and report back. The dwarves are not impressed with your incompetence.
3793:The south tunnels lead deep underground, and you soon come to a chamber where you spot an old werewolf sleeping. You suspect that he is not alone here.{}{}{}{}He sleeps in an alcove, and you see that it might be possible to collapse it, but you need to figure out the exact spots where to weaken the structure, or it will collapse on you also.
3794:Try to collapse it to be rid of the werewolves.
3795:[Werewolf]Dominate this pack!
3796:The werewolves are gone and you are able to clear the rest of this cave without further dangers.{}{}{}{}The dwarves are happy with your results and reward you well.
3797:The werewolves tear into you and their rage is terrifying. You manage to escape only because the pack could not follow you out for some reason. The dwarves are not impressed with your incompetence.
3798:The pack leaves, bowing to your superiority. The dwarves are grateful for your quick intervention. They reward you well and your friendship grows. 
3799:You spot the ruins of the old forge, and even from afar you see a thick, dark mist hanging low on the ground, still as death.
3800:[Dwarf]You sense the barrier that your brethren spoke of, and you know you will not be able to enter. If you have no companions with you, leave this place for now.
3801:As you get closer, you hear the sound of a working forge from within the ruined stones. You even feel the warmth of the fires upon your skin. 
3802:[Light]Call upon your domain to shield you from darkness and lead you to the light within. 
3803:[Turmoil]Call out to the darkness that you feel pulsating all around you. Demand that it face you.
3804:[Shadow elf]You sense the presence of a mroki, a fellow creature of dark shadows. Speak to it.
3805:Call out to whomever resides within.
3806:Go in weapons blazing!
3807:You call upon the light and it guides you in, past the many wards. {}{}{}{}Within the forge you see a burning furnace, an anvil, and all the trappings you'd expect, but behind the hammer stands a creature of the dark -- a mroki. It looks at you, its empty eyes revealing no emotion:{}{}{}{}'You smell of the light. Are you here to smite me?'
3808:Say that the dwarves asked you to reclaim their ancient forge. It is important to them, so they won't let it go.
3809:Yes, kill it in the name of light!
3810:You call upon the light and it guides you in, past the many wards. {}{}{}{}Within the forge you see a burning furnace, an anvil, and all the trappings you'd expect, but behind the hammer stands a creature of the dark -- a mroki. It looks at you, its empty eyes revealing no emotion:{}{}{}{}'You smell of the darkness of turmoil. Have you come for a weapon, or do you wish to fight me? One never knows with you chaotic types.'
3811:You call upon the light and it guides you in, past the many wards. {}{}{}{}Within the forge you see a burning furnace, an anvil, and all the trappings you'd expect, but behind the hammer stands a creature of the dark -- a mroki. It looks at you, its empty eyes revealing no emotion:{}{}{}{}'Dark friend, welcome. How can I aid you?'
3812:The dark mist rises up to your waist now, and a huge shadow appears and speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'What?'
3813:Say that the dwarves want their forge back. 
3814:'I claimed this place and warded it against the nuisance that are the stone folk. Now they send you.'
3815:[Intelligence]Ask what he is and why he took the forge.
3816:Insist that the forge belongs to the dwarves and they are stubborn. They will surely continue to harass him here. 
3817:'I am a mroki, a creature of darkness is what you know of me. Does it matter? I feel an affinity to stone and metal, a stirring of old lives a calling of the fire, who knows? I am here to forge.'
3818:[Wisdom]Say that the dwarves pay great respect to their forefathers and fallen heroes. It sounds like the mroki has at least an echo of such a dwarf inside, so you will tell the dwarves of this, and perhaps the two of them can come to an agreement.
3819:'I warded against them because they kept coming to fight. If they come to talk, I will listen.'{}{}{}{}The mroki hands you a small gift and goes back to work.
3820:Thank him and go tell the dwarves.
3821:'A mroki with memories of a dwarven smith, eh? I'll be damned if it ain't worth seein'. Ya did well, laddie. Keep this up and we'll be mates soon.'
3822:'A filthy creature of darkness claims it has the spirit of a dwarven smith? Ridiculous! It is better we destroy the forge entirely than let it spout this nonsense. Ya go away now, lassie!'
3823:'For you, a mroki is a creature of darkness, and we are that, but how do we come to be? I don't know the answer, but I feel many minds within me. Perhaps those lost to darkness? Or just dark thoughts of those who encountered turmoil in its purest form? In any case, the dwarven mind speaks loudly to me, so I came here to forge weapons. That's all.'
3824:Say that while you sympathise, the dwarves are very possessive of their forges, so the mroki must leave.
3825:'Yes, yes, that we -- or they -- are. I will go, for the voice in my mind does not want to spill dwarven blood. You spoke well. Here, you may have better use of this than me.'{}{}{}{}The mroki hands you a gift, then dissolves into shadow, and you feel the black mist leave with him. 
3826:'A mroki with memories of a dwarven smith, eh? I'll be damned. I ain't sure if that's blasphemy or wisdom. Still, the forge is ours by right. We thank ya for the service, laddie.'
3827:'No! I claimed this forge for it is mine, and those children of stone can wait their turn. Leave!'
3828:'A shame, lassie, a shame. Ya ain't so useful after all, eh?'{}{}{}{}The dwarves have to deal with the problem themselves, so your friendship does not grow.
3829:'The forge has been reclaimed and a filthy mroki destroyed. Good. We thank ya for the service, laddie.'
3830:You are badly beaten and forced to flee.{}{}{}{}The dwarves have to deal with the problem themselves, so your friendship does not grow.
3831:'For you, a mroki is a creature of darkness, and we are that, but how did we come to be so? I don't know the answer, but I feel many minds within me. Perhaps those lost to darkness? Or just dark thoughts of those who encountered turmoil in its purest form? In any case, the dwarven mind speaks loudly to me, so I came here to forge weapons. That's all.'
3832:'You know we mroki are creatures moulded from darkness and shadow. You too hear many voices. I feel many minds within me. Perhaps those lost to darkness? Or just dark thoughts of those who encountered turmoil in its purest form? In any case, the dwarven mind speaks loudly to me, so I came here to forge weapons. That's all. But if you ask, I will leave.'
3833:Tell him that the dwarves are stubborn arses and you need to be on good terms with them, so yes, ask your shadow friend to go.
3834:'Yes. I will go, for the voice in my mind does not want to spill dwarven blood. You spoke well. Here, you may have better use of this than me.'{}{}{}{}The mroki hands you a gift, then dissolves into shadow, and you feel the black mist leave with him. 
3835:You approach the graveyard where the earthbound dwarves sent you to deal with some skeletons.
3836:[Unliving]No need to kill. Tell your unliving brethren to abandon the battlegrounds.
3837:You prepare a ritual to disrupt the dark magic that animates these bones. This will make destroying them much easier. Now that they are weakened, you can face them in the spirit realm and completely destroy the dark magic.{}{}
3838:You speak to your skeletal kin, and they listen and take strength from your divine influence, despite their life force being held by the dark magic that animates them. {}{}{}{}They are not awakened like you, but your words make them want to break free. You see them fighting an internal battle, and in the end they win -- they collapse on the floor, lifeless and free again.
3839:You speak to your skeletal kin, and they listen and take strength from your divine influence, despite their life force being held by the dark magic that animates them. {}{}{}{}Your brethren beg you to come with them, to guide them away from the dark and onto a better path. They are not ready to join others and need you to leave with them.
3840:You set the traps and the orc skeletons burn to ash. {}{}{}{}The dwarves thank you for getting rid of the nuisance and they leave a reward.
3841:The orc skeletons defeat your efforts and swarm you. The dwarves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
3842:These unliving bones must have been away from their master for a long time. They listen to your commands as if they were yearning for someone to give one.{}{}{}{}They move away, but the dwarves are angry that you did not kill the scourge.
3843:These unliving bones must have been away from their master for a long time. They listen to your commands as if they were yearning for someone to give one.{}{}{}{}They move away, but the dwarves are angry that you did not kill the scourge. As a mark of their honour, they pay you for the job, but your friendship does not grow.
3844:As you go in closer, you see the ruins of an old arena, and within, several unliving corpses are fighting. A figure clad in black robes stands above them and watches intensely with one arm raised high above his head.
3845:The unliving orcs beat you badly and force you to flee. The dwarves have to come to your rescue and are not impressed with your 'help.'
3846:The dwarves are stumped by what that necromancer was, but they've heard of male orc children that use magic being killed because they turn evil, so perhaps it is true after all.{}{}{}{}They thank you for getting rid of the scourge and leave a reward.
3847:You destroy the binding spell and the unliving orcs collapse in a pile of bones. {}{}{}{}The dwarves thank you for getting rid of the nuisance and they leave a reward.
3848:You destroy the skeletons and burn the remains so they do not rise again.{}{}{}{}The dwarves thank you for getting rid of the nuisance and they leave a reward.
3849:The wraith does not speak, but it gestures that it will now serve you.
3850:'No!' The necromancer turns at the last minute, shouts a power word, and disappears, taken by dark tendrils into the shadows.{}{}{}{}The skeletons collapse, freed from his domain, so you burn them to make sure he cannot take control again.
3851:They move away, but the dwarves are angry that you did not kill the scourge. As a mark of their honour, they pay you for the job, but your friendship does not grow.
3852:The dwarves are angry that you did not kill the scourge. As a mark of their honour, they pay you for the job, but your friendship does not grow.
3853:Among the rubble and stones, you find several underground pockets where a dwarven city once lay. {}{}{}{}From one such entrance, you see light and hear the thudding of hammer against anvil. 
3854:[Dwarf]Go forth, but check for hidden traps and runestones. No dwarven smith works unguarded. 
3855:You enter a large stone chamber with furnaces and anvils spread across it, some fallen to ruin, some still intact. One furnace burns hot with a dwarven blacksmith at the anvil, hard at work. {}{}{}{}He nods at your arrival but does not speak. 
3856:[Dwarf]Greet the blacksmith according to custom.
3857:Speak to the dwarf. Ask him what he is doing here on his own.
3858:Kill the smith!
3859:You strike the dwarven smith and, surprisingly, he turns into rubble with just one hit.{}{}{}{}Children of stone and metal, or worshippers of Svarog[R9], both feel the heavy burden of this dark deed.{}{}{}{}As the smith turns to rubble, so does everything around you, and you are forced to run before you get buried here. {}{}
3860:Take what stone you can salvage and leave.
3861:You strike the dwarven smith and, surprisingly, he turns into rubble with just one hit.{}{}{}{}Your souls feel the burden of the deed, which conflicts with one of your divine domains. As the smith turns to rubble, so does everything around you, and you are forced to run before you get buried here. {}{}
3862:You strike the dwarven smith and, surprisingly, he turns into rubble with just one hit.{}{}{}{}As the smith turns to rubble, so does everything around you, and you are forced to run before you get buried here. {}{}
3863:'On me own, you say? Hmm. This here is our temple, or as close as for your understanding. I am a smith, and I tend this place. {}{}{}{}Better not dwell here too long, laddies, or the old brothers may take offence at your presence.'
3864:Call upon light and Svarog to give praise to this sacred place. 
3865:If this is a sacred place, ask if you can pay your respects.
3866:'Now that's a sight for sore eyes, aye. Good day to ya, my fellow, good day.{}{}{}{}I'd offer ya ale and mutton, but bein' the smith on duty at this temple, I am bound to keep the fires hot and the anvil busy.'
3867:Nod in understanding of the old dwarven custom and join your kin at his work. 
3868:'Ah, the young human smith and his kin - a good pupil he was, good promise for one not made of stone and metal.{}{}{}{}Come, join me at my work. We shall give honour to the metal, and I guess your gods too. Why not?'
3869:Work with the dwarven smith.
3870:'Well, I say, not many strangers ask me that. {}{}{}{}Sure, why not, come work with me. If the old brothers deem your work fitting, ya may get yourself a blessing.'
3871:'The forefather and old brothers like your work indeed. This is what I call good metal! Good on ya. {}{}{}{}Here, carry it with pride. Good travels. Stone and metal be with ya.'{}{}
3872:Take the forged weapon, give thanks to the forefather and the old brothers, and leave the smith to his work.
3873:'The forefather and old brothers like your work well enough. Good on ya. {}{}{}{}Here, carry it with pride. Good travels. Stone and metal be with ya.'{}{}
3874:'Well, ya tried, that you did. Good on ya. {}{}{}{}Stone and metal be with ya, lassies.'{}{}
3875:Thank the smith and leave.
3876:You move forwards carefully and discover several protective runes, but they do not light up. Either they are inactive, or you have been spotted already and the host is letting you pass. 
3877:Go forwards. 
3878:Through a great tear in the ground, you venture into the ruins of a dwarven city. {}{}{}{}It has been destroyed, full of rubble and debris, with the skeletal remains of those who perished here violently. You also see what killed them:{}{}{}{}In the centre of the once-great place, you see the skeletal remains of a dragon and giant intertwined in battle.
3879:Take from these titans what you can salvage. 
3880:'Oi, ya! Beat it, this is our find!'{}{}{}{}A couple of burly dwarven fighters stand in your way, weapons at the ready.
3881:[Dwarf]Ask them to calm down. Surely you can share in these spoils, as kin should. 
3882:[Light]Call upon light and assert that there is no need to spill blood among like-minded folk.
3883:[Intellect and harmony]Speak to their common sense. Say that this place is vast and there is enough for all of you to profit without the need for violence. 
3884:'Aye, brothers, aye, no need for brawlin'. Tell ya what, you go scavenge that end, we do this end, and whoever salvages more's the winner, eh? Go!'{}{}{}{}The dwarves run to their side and start rummaging and digging.
3885:Go do your side, quick!
3886:'Ah, your ?gods,? aye, that light of yours seems like an honourable sort of path. {}{}{}{}We ain't that fussed about kickin' your butts, so you can wait till we're done, then take what is left.'
3887:Try to convince them to split the spoils evenly.
3888:You kill the dwarves and now can loot the site in peace.
3889:Take the salvage and leave.
3890:The dwarves beat you, but they let you run away, clearly more interested in salvaging than in kicking your butts.
3891:'Ah, you buggers are good! Well done. Here, have this bit of metal we found. Metal and stone be with ya, laddies!'{}{}{}{}The dwarves collect their smaller pile of salvage and depart, singing dirty songs and cheering for a good day's work.
3892:'Ha! We beat ya fair and square, but it was a good contest. Metal and stone strengthen ya, laddies!'{}{}{}{}The dwarves collect their considerably larger pile of salvage and depart, singing dirty songs and cheering for a good day's work.
3893:'What sort of slivering babes are ya? Give up? Shame, shame on ya, lassies.'{}{}{}{}The dwarves gather their considerably larger pile of salvage and leave, shaking their heads. 
3894:'Bah, ya have one of those silver tongues, ya do! We do our end and ya do yours. Who knows who'll get the better pick, but it seems fair. Metal and stone be with ya, laddies!'{}{}{}{}The dwarves move away to salvage their part.
3895:Great. Search your part and leave.
3896:'You're gettin' on my nervous side. Ya better leave, now.'
3897:A couple of burly dwarven fighters stand in the ruins gathering loot and looking about with angry grimaces.
3898:[Dwarf]Greet your kin and ask if you can both share in searching this place.
3899:Wait till the dwarves leave and gather what is left.
3900:Sneak past the dwarves and loot behind their backs. 
3901:Ambush them. You have the advantage.
3902:You wait until the dwarves depart, but they do not leave much behind.{}{}{}{}Your scout, however, improved their skill.
3903:You wait until the dwarves leave and gather up what remains to be salvaged. 
3904:You find a spot away from the dwarves, and although it will surely yield less than the main area, you are able to collect your loot safely. 
3905:Gather the spoils and leave.
3906:The dwarves spot you and charge!
3907:You find a huge sinkhole and within, you see the rubble of an old city. {}{}{}{}More importantly, there's a chest intact.
3908:You spot a dragon -- the one who stole from you!
3909:As you enter the dwarven settlement, you realise it is nothing but rubble and bent, melted metal. {}{}{}{}As you look closer, you see body parts, faces of stone or iron, shattered into pieces and scattered. {}{}{}{}The city is dead.
3910:You are led to the town hall, a heavy, stone-built monument of dwarven excellence. There, you are met by a council of elders, including a dwarven female who sits in the back and occasionally nods when the others look to her.
3911:Tell them of your discovery of the red cave and the Alchemist who claims it is the answer to the Shattering.
3912:'Aye, we've long been searching for the red cave, as you call it. The Shattering disturbed our tunnels and cities down below, and it will take us decades to find all we lost, and even then that won't be all of it. Trying to keep our young safe, the dwarf wives too - this has been our priority, but perhaps we were wrong.'
3913:So they admit the Shattering has something to do with them?
3914:Do they know how to solve it all? You have no time to talk. [Skip Story]
3915:'Aye, that it does. Something, everything. The earth-heart is the core that connected to the cosmic tree. Only together can they create balance. {}{}{}{}Our grandfather, a great giant of old, one of the first earth-singers, he gave his own heart so that this may happen.'
3916:Why? How was it before the heart?
3917:Then why is the earth shattering?
3918:'Before the heart was a primal time, one of giants and nature demons. The child of light and its sibling of darkness forever danced their destructive melody. We are not old enough to know more, but this is what was carved in stone. {}{}{}{}When we and the elven kin were brought from the light, we were told we must help tame the children.'
3919:With the cosmic tree?
3920:'Aye, in some ways. You see, with the tree, and others like it all over Thea, your gods were born also. They were the spawn of the light and dark, but also of the mortal realm. At least this is what our history teaches. I think others say they were born of belief, a need, an outcry of your kin - silly. They were carved, just like us, for a purpose they may have surpassed, but that was their design.'
3921:But the cosmic tree is guarded by the gods, so why wasn't the heart?
3922:'The heart was kept a secret from all. And this is where our duty failed. All else that happened, happened because of our folly.'
3923:How so?
3924:'When your gods came and grew in strength, the elven kin decided to let them be stewards of the tree entirely, and some of our youth felt we should do so too. Foolish, rough stones they were!{}{}{}{}When the tree burnt, they went and told your gods that there was hope, that the core was well, so the tree will be reborn no matter what they do up above.'
3925:So they think it was your gods that betrayed the heart?
3926:'A secret once spoiled rots away and spreads. We told those young fools. We banished them. We . . . silenced those who knew where to look for the earth-heart. {}{}{}{}And then, when the culprits found their way into the heart chamber, we were no longer prepared, because we trusted in the old safeguards and did not have the grandmasters who could tell us how to change things.'
3927:What of the grandmaster held by the trolls in the prison? The Alchemist said he knew one.
3928:Silenced?
3929:Do they know who destroyed the heart, and how?
3930:'That despicable creature is not a grandmaster! He is sick. He is cruel. And he shall never again have a say in our fate. Leave him be. Leave him to rot. And never trust his dark words!'
3931:'It matters not. It was some cult. We suspect a greater mind behind it. We care not. {}{}{}{}What we know is we need a new heart, and seeing as we failed so badly before, we will help ya restore things. Our time is passing, and we must accept it.'
3932:Can they forge another heart?
3933:But now that you have found the cave, do they not want to be the ones to take care of it?
3934:'We searched for the cave, but we've also been preparing for this question. We could forge ya a stone heart, sure. But without a giant - and they are all asleep once more - it would be too weak. {}{}{}{}Go to the ice lands, seek out the old dziad mroz.'{}{}
3935:What for? Kill him and take his heart?
3936:'We will help. But as I said, the Shattering tore our world asunder in ways I cannot explain.{}{}{}{}We are rebuilding, or surviving. But we cannot and will not endanger what we saved, not even for the earth-heart. Perhaps we learnt from you mortals, but our family comes before other duties.'
3937:[Dwarf]Bow in understanding and thank them for doing what they can for dwarf kind. Even though you are too young to know the secrets, you know full well that the safety of the young ones and the dwarf wives must come first.
3938:'Aye, I am glad your time with the gods didn't make ya forget.'
3939:'The earth shatters because the giant's heartbeat gave it natural rhythm. But more than that, it is the child of light trying to escape its underground confines, just as darkness did ages ago. Think of it this way - there was a plug that held things together, and now there is a hole, but a small one, too small for the enormous power that seeks a way out. So it is making its own cracks. You need a new plug, else it will keep going.'
3940:How was it before the heart?
3941:'What? No, are ya crazy, laddie? Dziad mroz has no heart. That is the point of him. {}{}{}{}We need whatever gives him life -- the substitute. We tried asking him, we tried beating him up. Nothing works. Perhaps ya will have greater luck. Fate seems to favour your lot.'
3942:What happened once you got this secret of his?
3943:'We failed to guard the first heart - one from the giant. We then lost the entrance to the red cave, and it seems fate likes ya more. The Shattering destroyed our homes beneath, and we need to stay put. So we cannot solve it ourselves, but we will help ya. {}{}{}{}Go look for a dziad mroz in the ice lands.'
3944:'We will send people to this Alchemist of yours, into the red cave. We will find a way into the heart chamber and prepare a new heart rune that will need attuning to the power ya will hopefully bring back for us.{}{}{}{}And if we can, we will send folk to help ya along the way and help with the light-beast at the end. Now go. Find the dziad mroz.'
3945:Go look for the dziad mroz, then. Leave.
3946:'. . .'
3947:You find the dziad mroz that the dwarves sent you to seek out. He stands watching you silently. But a young girl, made of ice, approaches you:{}{}{}{}'You are searching for grandfather? Why?'
3948:Explain what the dwarves told you. Ask for their help to stop the Shattering.
3949:The dziad mroz remains still, and the girl answers after a pause:{}{}{}{}'Yes. So they said, many times. We do not share our secrets - something the dwarves should have learnt, no? Go away, before my sisters decide to play with you.'
3950:[Demon]Dziad mroz is an ancient demon, but still a demon and bound by your laws. Challenge it to a game of wits.
3951:[Harmony or Intellect]Call upon your domain for inspiration. All demons are weaved from darkness. When this light breaks loose completely, not even these ice plains will remain untouched. Tell the dziad mroz his ice granddaughters will surely melt away under the burning gaze of the lightbringers.
3952:[Magic user or Magic]Demons, especially the ancient ones, are ruled by mystical powers and demon laws. Challenge the demon to a spiritual game. 
3953:All demons are weaved from darkness. When this light breaks loose completely, not even these ice plains will remain untouched. Tell the dziad mroz his ice granddaughters will surely melt away under the burning gaze of the lightbringers.
3954:You kill the dziad mroz. But his heart simply melts away and dead demons cannot give you answers.
3955:Move out.
3956:'Yes. You have mastered my nature.' An old, deep voice now speaks through the young girl.{}{}{}{}'A conundrum I long feared. Bound by nature as I am, as we all are, I must now betray what is most precious to me.'
3957:Say you care little for his moral troubles. You need this information.
3958:Promise that you will not divulge this secret beyond what is needed to stop the Shattering.
3959:'You bested me in a challenge, so I must speak the truth now. {}{}{}{}It is a lie that I live with no heart - I simply gave it away long ago. And then later, much later, I found a way so that my frozen heart would allow my love a life she always wanted. If I give you this secret, she will have to suffer again.'
3960:She?
3961:'She was once lady of winter, but also mistress of rebirth - the circle of life and death. Every spring day she would have to die so the circle could continue. {}{}{}{}So I found a way. I became the winter myself, forsaking all spring, forsaking my heart - and my heart was that of spring, of hope. So yes, you can use it, for it has great power.'
3962:And that love of yours will have to return to her role?
3963:'Yes, she will once again need to die for us. And I, I will become even more of an ice creature. {}{}{}{}But you see, she told me this when I did what I did. She laughed and said the wheel will turn no matter what I do. She thanked me for the short respite I gave her and walked off, free. Till now.'
3964:What is her name?
3965:'That secret I will keep. Now, once you take my heart, I will not know you, so when we meet again, my cold anger will run deep. Try to stay away. You see me as one here, but I am water. I do not die. I come again. I come as many.{}{}{}{}And when my heart keeps this prison and my Lady is forced to suffer again, winter may lash out for a time, it may change your world.'
3966:The dziad mroz points towards an icicle and walks away. When you get to it, you see a single snowdrop inside. {}{}{}{}One of you reaches for the icicle and the frost chills them to the bone. 
3967:Hold on to the ice heart.
3968:The ice reaches so deep into your soul that it never lets go. You awake as a sniezynka, your heart frozen, your mind cold. Only through your faith do you retain your sense of self, despite the daunting, ever-present call of the winter grandfather.{}{}{}{}You hold the frozen snowdrop and can now take it to the red cave for the dwarves.
3969:The ice reaches so deep into your soul, it feels as if it will never let go. But eventually, your divine connections force the ice out and you feel yourself again. Only your spirit and mind feel weakened. {}{}{}{}You hold the frozen snowdrop and can now take it to the red cave for the dwarves.
3970:'No. I am bound by eternal promise never to give up what you seek. Search elsewhere. Kill me. But you will not succeed here.'
3971:Kill him!
3972:The dwarf who sent you here approaches:{}{}{}{}'Ai, this was always a long shot. Ya best seek answers with others now, my kin is stuck in their ways, they will take forever to discuss this matter and come up with a new plan. Good fortune to ya, laddie, iron and stone.'{}{}
3973:You are defeated and one of you is frozen to death.
3974:'Yes. You speak well.' An old, deep voice now speaks through the young girl.{}{}{}{}'A conundrum I long feared. Bound by nature as I am, as we all are, I must now betray what is most precious to me.'
3975:'I... don't know how to thank you for this. You shall be friend to me always. One of my granddaughters will accompany you so you may fulfil your task, without hurting my love. Fare thee well, god-child.'
3976:Wish him well too.
3977:'There is a final price. One of you must retrieve my heart, and when they do, they may come out changed forever.'
3978:Accept the terms.
3979:Say that you will look for other ways. This one seems cruel.
3980:A dwarven smith waves you over:{}{}{}{}'Ya proved your stone will and metal arm to us, some of our youngsters find ya interestin'. We gave them permission to join ya if they wish.'{}{}{}{}[You can only recruit in this faction once, with a tiny chance for second when your population is very low]{}{}
3981:Go ask if there is any smiths that want to join?
3982:Go ask if there is any labourers are interested?
3983:Some children look at you, go ask them.
3984:There doesn't seem anyone interested to join you right now.
3985:A young smith looks your way. But they ask that you pay for their services.
3986:Pay a young smith.
3987:Pay a smith.
3988:A labourer looks your way. But they ask that you pay for their services.
3989:Pay them.
3990:A dwarven child is permitted to join your village, so they may truly learn your customs. You will have to pay as is customary, to ensure the dwarven clan is compensated for the loss.
3991:Welcome them.
3992:Someone approaches you.
3993:Stay alert.
3994:As you're about to set up camp, a group of goblin travellers approaches, asking for shelter. 
3995:[Goblin]Greet your kin and welcome them to your camp.
3996:[Orc]Intimidate them into giving you their stuff or else you'll attack.
3997:Welcome them to your camp. You should be helping one another.
3998:It is the way of harmony to help. Invite them and share food.
3999:Welcome them to your camp. We should be helping one another.
4000:Refuse. You will not share bread with strangers. 
4001:The goblins sit by the fire and share stories with you. They pass around a strange weed, and soon you see visions of the spirits they speak of.{}{}
4002:The goblins sit by the fire and share stories with you. They pass around a strange weed, and soon you see visions of the spirits they speak of.{}{}{}{}There is a chance the spirits imparted wisdom to you as well. {}{}
4003:The goblins sit by the fire and share stories with you. They pass around a strange weed, and soon you see visions of the spirits they speak of.{}{}{}{}And then you realise you drifted off while they robbed you and ran off!
4004:Catch them and kill them!
4005:Damned thieves. Leave.
4006:You kill the goblins and loot their bodies.{}{}
4007:The goblins beat you and take some of your things, but they leave you alive, at least. {}{}
4008:It is wise to stay cautious. You feel your domain strengthen. 
4009:The goblins sit by the fire and share stories with you. They pass around a strange weed, and soon you see visions of the spirits they speak of.{}{}{}{}They like your company so much, they give you a stash of the weed and one of their puppies before they leave. {}{}
4010:'Oi, oi, easy there, fellas, easy. Here, have some of our stuff. And we, just, we go over there, yeah?'{}{}{}{}As the goblins walk off, you hear a lot of swearing.
4011:Take their stuff and continue setting up camp.
4012:'Oh, yes, here we go. You big, you strong, you beat up the gobbos, make you feel better, eh? Stupid oafs. {}{}{}{}We leave you be!'{}{}{}{}They walk off. 
4013:Let them go.
4014:The goblins sit by the fire and share stories with you. They pass around a strange weed, and soon you see visions of the spirits they speak of.{}{}{}{}You realise, however, that the stuff they shared was pretty strong, and you all feel very ill. {}{}
4015:You refuse and they walk off, but in the morning,  you realise they must have sneaked back and stolen some of your stuff!
4016:A group of elderly looking orcs approaches your camp. They show their hands in a gesture of peace, but they do still have weapons by their side. 
4017:Wait until they approach to see what they want.
4018:Stand firm and show them your weapons so they go on their way.
4019:'Good travels to you! May we join you and share meat and spirits?'
4020:[Orc]Nod, but ask them why a group of elders is not trying to die in the pits, but instead wandering the roads looking for friends.
4021:Refuse. It is never safe to trust strangers, especially not armed ones.
4022:The group sits by the fire and passes along some dried meat and strong spirits:{}{}{}{}'I am Broken Night Walker. It is an honour to drink and eat together. This way, we are not enemies. The rite of journey binds us. Would you youngsters like to hear some elder wisdom?'{}{}
4023:[Orc]Say that you think they will ask you now:  what is best in life?
4024:[Elf]Assert that you are hardly a 'youngster' yourself.
4025:Agree, and ask if this means some kind of combat.
4026:Decline respectfully. 
4027:The orcs are dead.
4028:Gather their loot and leave.
4029:The elderly orcs beat you badly and take some of your stuff, but they spare your lives. 
4030:'Ha, if only we were younger, we could have ourselves a good old beating. But no, you have not offended our honour, nor we yours. {}{}{}{}We are elder, a rarity for our kind, I'll have you know. {}{}{}{}We simply ask you: what is best in life??
4031:Warm soup, good teeth, and a strong bladder.
4032:To go through life at peace with yourself.
4033:To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their men.
4034:After resting awhile, the orcs move on, leaving you a small thank-you gift.
4035:'Yes, yes, a warm meal, teeth to eat it with, and a bladder that won't make you piss yourself -- that is what you treasure in old age.{}{}{}{}And before you ask, it is not what most of our kind believes, but we are clanless, have been for decades. We found ourselves on a different path.'
4036:Thank them for their wisdom.
4037:'Stuff your stomachs with food, shit under yourselves, and die in a feather bed, eh? Never!{}{}{}{}Eat only the flesh of what you killed, fuck whomever you can, and respect a good enemy, for only they can give you honourable death!'{}{}
4038:Agree to disagree.
4039:Argue your point.
4040:'True, in our old age, we seek to be at peace, to end the turmoil and rest.{}{}{}{}And before you ask, it is not what most of our kind believes, but we are clanless, have been for decades. We found ourselves on a different path.'
4041:'It is what we once thought, believed, lived by. {}{}{}{}But is it true? And do you believe it, or did you say so to please our old ears?{}{}{}{}Our lesson, then, is: if an old orc can say peace is not a lie, anything in life can change.'
4042:'Yes, yes! Ah, good, you already know the path to glory!{}{}{}{}You do not need our wisdom, then, but you may need a good blade to practise what we preach!'{}{}{}{}The orc hands you her weapon.
4043:'Good, I feared your time with the human gods may have tamed your spirits. So, answer me?'
4044:Your clarity of mind sits well with the domain of intellect. {}{}{}{}You feel strengthened. {}{}
4045:You see a flash of fire in their eyes, but the one who leads them holds out her hand:{}{}{}{}'We are on a journey and will find honour in death, but not here. That is all we will say.'
4046:Nod again, and gesture for them to sit.
4047:Growl at their breaking of tradition.
4048:'You are not one to speak, follower of human deities.{}{}{}{}We honour our ways. We are elder. You'll be wise to clench your teeth and listen, pup!'
4049:Nod, and gesture for them to sit.
4050:Tell them it is time they earned their death honour. Attack!
4051:'Bah, you surprise me, young one. Somehow I feel it is we who are being tested here. {}{}{}{}You'd like me to say now, NO! That is wisdom for weaklings!{}{}{}{}But a warm meal, teeth to eat it with, and a bladder that won't make you piss yourself -- that is what you treasure in old age.'
4052:Question their honour and heritage. Ask where they come from.
4053:Agree. Say that you too have found a wiser path in life through the cosmic pantheon. Thank them and wish them well on their journey.
4054:'You mock us, mongrel pup! You'd be wise to respect age, for I have skinned and mounted many a youngster like yourself, and I am not done yet!'
4055:Apologise. Give the correct answer: crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their men!
4056:Assert that your answer is the right one, for you have changed your path. 
4057:'Ha, I suppose this was easy enough, but I did worry that your human pantheon had stifled the fire within you.{}{}{}{}Yes, pup, and do you know the true meaning behind it yet?'
4058:Stay forever in motion, embrace change, and spit on peace and stagnation.
4059:Say that the meaning is literal. 
4060:'Good, good. We are on our way to fight a final battle. {}{}{}{}Our young were slain. We go to avenge our clan and die in fire. But you, you go with our blessing and our wisdom. Tear your enemies apart and burn your friends with passion!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and later you find they left you a gift.
4061:Bow in respect of the elders. 
4062:'Hmm, you have a ways to go yet, but your spirit is true.{}{}{}{}Our young were slain. We go to avenge our clan and die in fire. But you, you go with our blessing and our wisdom. Tear your enemies apart and burn your friends with passion!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and later you find they left you a gift.
4063:'You're young, and your fire burns bright. Yet you too walk a path apart from your clan, no? {}{}{}{}We are clanless, have been for many decades. And we had to learn that the old ways are not the only path. {}{}{}{}So this is our wisdom for you. Soothe your fires, extinguish them if you can, and perhaps peace will be your reward.'
4064:Spit in their face and tell them to leave, now!
4065:Attack them for this insolence!
4066:Agree and thank them for the lesson. 
4067:The orcs only nod and move away. You see one of them is struggling not to hit you, but he follows his matriarch out.{}{}{}{}Despite the abrupt ending, you feel you have learned a valuable lesson today: not all of your kin are sane.{}{}
4068:The elderly orcs have earned their death honour now!
4069:Commit them to the funeral pyres. 
4070:'Young, insolent pups!{}{}{}{}But you fought well. You have fire in your souls and it makes us proud, even though we walk another path. May peace be with you.'{}{}{}{}The last words are spoken with much amusement, as the orcs know they sting you hard. The orcs walk off, but they take one weapon from you.
4071:Leave in shame. 
4072:'Bah, you surprise me, young one. Somehow I feel it is we who are being tested here. {}{}{}{}You'd like me to say now, NO! That is wisdom for weaklings!{}{}{}{}But peace is not a lie.'
4073:'Bah, you surprise me, young one. I thought following the human gods may have changed you for the better. {}{}{}{}The constant turmoil, the warring, the change -- these are not the only ways.'
4074:'Bah, it's a matter of seeing, isn't it? For your kind, you look young to me, with none of the dark taint from days of darkness. So, what, a few centuries at best? Baby by your standards, no?{}{}{}{}I am messing with you. Now, you want to listen to old orc wisdoms, or no?'
4075:'Ha, if only we were younger, we could have ourselves a good old beating. But no, you have not offended our honour, nor we yours. {}{}{}{}We are elder -- well, maybe not for you, but still -- a rarity for our kind, I'll have you know. We simply ask you: what is best in life??
4076:'Ha, somehow I guessed you long-ears would go for that. {}{}{}{}But what is peace if not stagnation, eh? If your harmony and light prevailed, as it seeks to do now, we would all be empty husks. {}{}{}{}Change, conflict, passion -- only if you accept them will you achieve your peace, my long-living friend.'{}{}
4077:Bow in thanks for the lesson.
4078:Smile and assert that ones as crude and short-lived as they cannot seek to teach you anything true.
4079:The orc shrugs her shoulders and continues to tell orcish stories till they all go to sleep. {}{}{}{}You are surprised they did not take offence nor offer any verbal riposte. This act proved a more valuable lesson than their words. 
4080:'You fucking pointy-eared snobs never change! We try to be all civil-like, pass on life lessons, but all you can do is spit on us. So now we will show you what you expected, scum!'{}{}{}{}They charge at you!
4081:'Indeed, we have come to understand just that. {}{}{}{}By the faint twitch in your brow, elder one, I assume your surprise. As you walk the path of the human deities, so did we find that path. Balance is what we seek. {}{}{}{}But remember, creature of harmony, balance only happens when you also allow the other side in.'
4082:'Ha, I'd never guess you long-ears would go for that. {}{}{}{}But what is peace if not stagnation, eh? If your harmony and light prevailed, as it seeks to do now, we would all be empty husks. {}{}{}{}But change, conflict, passion -- only if you accept them will we achieve true glory!'{}{}
4083:'You are young and follow those smooth-talking gods of yours, but you have Zorya, you have Triglav, you have Horz, so you listen to them, pup! Do not let your hearts go soft or the enemy will destroy us all!'
4084:Insist that warfare is not wisdom, only a means one must sometimes use.
4085:You see the old orc's eyes blaze as she clenches her fist, but she exhales and only adds:{}{}{}{}'You asked for our wisdom, and we gave it. You are not our enemy. We seek our death honour elsewhere. We should rest now, for you never know what the light may bring in the morn.'
4086:'Shame, shame on you, pup. You will die an honourless death; the mothers will not embrace you, and Zorya will never hunt by your side. Shame...'
4087:The orcs take your stance as a challenge and charge!
4088:'Peace. Sing songs and hold hands like the pinty ears, eh? Never!{}{}{}{}Eat only the flesh of what you killed, fuck whomever you can, and respect a good enemy, for only they can give you honourable death!'{}{}
4089:As you set up camp, a group of elves approach you carefully. Most of the group is carried on stretchers, ill.{}{}{}{}'May we seek shelter at your side?'
4090:[Harmony]As the path of harmony dictates, ask them in.
4091:Invite them in.
4092:Tell the strangers they must camp elsewhere, as you will not endanger your own.
4093:It is the strongest who will survive in this world. Attack!
4094:'I thank thee, friends. I feel you walk the path of harmony or light. This is good.{}{}{}{}My brethren were assaulted by necromancy, and a curse now blights their light. We do not have a mage with us, thus we make haste to our home. Alas, I do not think they have that much time left.'
4095:[Elf mage]This curse is made of darkness. Use your elven light and mastery of magic to try to cleanse your brethren, even if it hurts you. 
4096:[Striga masters]Say that you can smell the curse and you know it well. You can take it.
4097:[Magic users]Since it is a curse, offer to try to break it with a cleansing ritual.
4098:Offer them a place to rest, for you cannot do anything more.
4099:Tell them they must leave, for you do not have wise ones and you do not want a curse.
4100:The path of intellect or nature is not driven by sympathy. You feel strengthened by your resolve. {}{}
4101:You kill the elves and feel not only that turmoil has protected you from a curse these enemies carried, but also that you have been blessed by this swift act of conflict.{}{}
4102:You are defeated. The elves depart and do not seek to kill you, but a curse they carried rubbed off on you during combat.{}{}
4103:You kill the elves. Alas, their souls were inflicted with a dark curse, and some of it now clings to your spirits!{}{}
4104:Despite your best efforts, the curse is too strong. Several of the elves perish, their bodies turning to silver dust, and you sing the song of life to speed them on their journey to light.{}{}{}{}Worse yet, a weaker remnant of the curse now ails you. Your surviving kin depart in a sombre mood, but they leave you a parting gift as thanks. {}{}
4105:The dark curse breaks under your assault, and your brethren soon recover their vitality. {}{}{}{}Hastened by duty, they depart, but they leave you with a blessing and gifts.{}{}
4106:The elves bow in thanks and tend to their sick. Alas, none of the afflicted lasts the night, and a remnant of the curse lingers on you!{}{}{}{}The elves apologise and depart in grief, leaving only some supplies behind.{}{}
4107:The elves bow in thanks and tend to their sick. Alas, none of the afflicted lasts the night. Their bodies turn to silver dust, and their kin sing a beautifully sorrowful song that fills your hearts with hope.{}{}{}{}The elves apologise and depart in grief, leaving some supplies and a gift.{}{}
4108:Among the gifts, you discover a pet. Take it in.
4109:You take the burning coals from the fire. To cleanse the soul with light, you cover the sick with oak leaves and dirt. To ask mother earth her blessing, you mix your saliva with three fingernails of an elder and the blood of an animal, and you drink it.{}{}{}{}The elves look at you with an air of confusion and disgust, but when their brethren rise, cleansed and healed, they bow to you and leave you gifts in thanks.{}{}
4110:The elves look at you with distrust, but nod.{}{}{}{}You sit by the cursed elfkin and let out your leech tongue into their necks. By taking their blood, you also take the curse.{}{}{}{}The blood hurts you, but you have cured them.
4111:Demand payment.
4112:Tell the elves their kin will be well now. 
4113:The elf who asked your aid scowls at you, but nods.{}{}{}{}'You have taken the darkness upon yourself, despite the hurt our blood caused you. This shall be remembered and rewarded.'{}{}{}{}They place a pack at your feet.
4114:'You have taken the darkness upon yourself, despite the hurt our blood caused you. This shall be remembered and rewarded.'{}{}{}{}They place a pack at your feet.
4115:'I thank thee, friends. {}{}{}{}My brethren were assaulted by necromancy, and a curse now blights their light. We do not have a mage with us, thus we make haste to our home. Alas, I do not think they have that much time left.'{}{}
4116:[Elf mage]This cure is made of darkness. Use your elven light and mastery of magic to try to cleanse your brethren, even if it hurts you. 
4117:A group of elderly humans approaches you.
4118:Invite them to join you.
4119:Kill them.
4120:Tell them to move along.
4121:'Ah, thank you, it is good to see some common courtesy in this troubled world. {}{}{}{}I am Professor Wilkoglov, and these are my colleagues. We are scholars, you see. If you let us stay with you awhile and feed us, we will teach you a thing or two.'
4122:Ask more about scholars.
4123:[Zerca]Say that you are honoured to welcome them. 
4124:[Elf]Say that you respect their endeavours, yet you remember a time when it was scholars who doomed the world to darkness.
4125:Agree. [Lose 30% food]
4126:You kill the elderly folk with no trouble. {}{}{}{}You find books written in a dialect unknown to you and some basic supplies. {}{}
4127:You kill the elderly folk without trouble, but their violent deaths twist their souls into wraiths!{}{}
4128:Face them in the spirit world.
4129:On the path of harmony, such senseless violence taints your spirit. {}{}
4130:You defeat the wraiths and their souls are destroyed.
4131:You defeat the wraiths.
4132:On the path of intellect and magic, knowledge is gold. {}{}{}{}You feel depressed for losing your chance to gain wisdom.
4133:The scholars stay awhile and pass on what knowledge they can before they move on. {}{}
4134:The scholars stay awhile and pass on what knowledge they can before they move on. {}{}{}{}They also leave a gift.{}{}
4135:After the welcome you gave, one of the wise ones decides to stay with you.
4136:The scholars stay awhile and pass on what knowledge they can before they move on.{}{}
4137:The wraiths' primal anger proves overwhelming. Fortunately, in their fresh confusion, they wander off seeking new victims, leaving you behind.
4138:'Our world was not always in such turmoil. Centuries ago, before darkness came, we had cities, universities!{}{}{}{}Now, since creatures of the night hunt our dreams and the light of day seeks to burn our souls while the earth continues to shatter -- well, there's little time for knowledge. Yet we endure. As learned men and women, we gather knowledge and write it down.'
4139:Ask what for.
4140:'For the future, of course. Once the world returns to a semblance of balance, we will once more require knowledge! It is our best weapon, our only saviour, our grace...'{}{}{}{}He trails off.
4141:Nod. 
4142:'Ah, a zerca, priest of the great gods of the pantheon. You, my friend, could likely answer many of our quarrels. {}{}{}{}Let us exchange knowledge, then, shall we? And we will require only very basic food and board.'
4143:Agree. [Lose 20% food]
4144:Say you cannot afford to lose the food. 
4145:The professor frowns, and the others shake their heads vigorously.{}{}{}{}'Propaganda, that is all. It was never quite proven. At least, there are no physical sources to suggest such a direct cause and effect -- perhaps a dash of meddling, some misguided experiments...'{}{}
4146:Insist that you know your history. 
4147:Let them off. 
4148:'Well, I say, your elven brains are bound to suffer from all that light and stagnation, you know. You have very little turmoil in you. This does not bode well for your progress, thus your minds can muddle the truth, yes...'
4149:Tell them politely that it is their minds that are fogged by age and decay.
4150:Tell them you will not tolerate such stupidity and ask them to leave.
4151:'In any case, would you like our schooling or not?'
4152:'If you let us stay with you awhile and feed us, we will teach you a thing or two.'
4153:'Yes, of course, hard times everywhere. Well, then, we will rest and move on. May wisdom guide your path.
4154:[Harmony]It is the way of harmony to help. Invite them and share food.
4155:The forest demons bring out various items they 'acquired' from those who trespass on their land.
4156:'You are no friends of ours, we do not like this exchange, so you will give more.'
4157:'Now, begone from our land.'
4158:You enter the territory claimed by the forest demons. You feel many eyes upon you.{}{}{}{}'What seek you here, stranger? We do not like outsiders lurking here.'
4159:[Wood folk or wisdom or friend] Offer the forest guardians a tribute to appease their anger.
4160:Ask if there is anything you can help with?
4161:You enter the territory claimed by the forest demons. You feel many eyes upon you.{}{}{}{}'Leave our land before the forest's anger devours you, outsider!{}{}{}{}
4162:The longer you linger here, the more you feel the forest's heavy toll upon your morale.{}{}{}{}'You come here carrying so much old wood! You dare ask our favour. Leave.'
4163:Better leave.
4164:The longer you linger here, the more you feel the forest's heavy toll upon your morale.{}{}{}{}'You, you and your kind always come with filthy axes, always burn and cut! Begone and may your bodies rot away.'
4165:'What will you offer?'
4166:Food offering, made of your own, cooked produce. 
4167:The offering of house animals, in payment of any wildlife that you hunted or will hunt.
4168:Axes to show you do not mean to defile the forest with them.
4169:'We accept your offering. You may enter and if any of my spirits wish it, they may bestow blessings on you.'
4170:Ask if they would trade with you?
4171:Await to see if the spirits will bless you in any way.
4172:Ask if they can train your demon pets.
4173:'You have proven friends to us so far, yes, we will trade with you.'
4174:A voice beckons you, go see what they want?
4175:'We accept your presence here. You may enter and if any of my spirits wish it, they may bestow blessings on you.'
4176:'Your spirit is ailing, we will take this taint from you.'
4177:Thank them, rest and leave.
4178:'Your body is ailing, we will take this taint from you.'
4179:You sit and watch the forest as it bustles with life and it is very relaxing. The forest whispers in your ear:{}{}{}{}'Leshy, Borowy, our guardian, can take many forms, bear being but one. This one will accompany you, perhaps teach you the ways of the forest, friend.' 
4180:You sit and watch the forest as it bustles with life and it is very relaxing.
4181:The forest demons are slain and you hear a dreadful whisper of the woodland around you...
4182:The forest defeats you and you barely escape with your lives as the trees and creatures tear into your flesh.
4183:The longer you linger here, the more you feel the forest's heavy toll upon your morale.{}{}{}{}'No, leave. Return with those who know of the forest, perhaps then we will listen.'
4184:From within the forest they speak to you:{}{}{}{}'Your pantheon calls Dievanna their daughter, and nature is one of your domains. I wish to join your path and learn more these gods who made you friends of the forest.'
4185:Accept whoever it is that wants to join.
4186:Refuse politely.
4187:The forest is moving towards you and it doesn't look too happy, you feel your spirit assailed by them.
4188:Defend your spirit!
4189:'Apologies, friends. We did not recognise you. Greetings and well wishes.'
4190:Meditate together.
4191:They do not answer, they keep coming towards you.
4192:You destroy the forest demons and their bodies shatter.{}{}
4193:The forest drains your spirit but allows you to run. You lose some of your things on the way.
4194:You defeat the forest demons.
4195:'You have demon companions, but their full potential may not be unlocked yet. For a fee, place them on the stone and we shall give them power.'{}{}{}{}[Training your pet will only raise it to fourth rank, no higher]
4196:Yes, give a skshack to be trained.
4197:Yes, give a cmuch to be trained.
4198:Pay with your spirit to train the cmuch.
4199:An armed group approaches.
4200:Convince them to trade.
4201:A pack of beasts approaches.
4202:[Beast] Howl at the moon together, buzz to a common tune, or simply run in unison with your kin for a time before asking them to move along.
4203:[Hunter] Stalk the beasts and hunt them down!
4204:You won!
4205:You failed and beasts chase you away.
4206:A mythical creature crosses your path!
4207:Convince them you are god's chosen and should be respected as such!
4208:[Mythical]Roar in mutual respect and recognition of kinship. Then ask them to move along from your turf.
4209:Face them as a spiritual challenge.
4210:You fail. You are beaten and chased away.
4211:You were badly beaten and forced to flee.
4212:You convinced the creature to leave you alone!
4213:You defeated the creature and as its soul shatters so does its body.
4214:You see trolls!
4215:[Troll] Grunt in greeting to your kin and ask them to move along from your territory.
4216:Bribe them with loads of food!
4217:The trolls abandon some goods as they leave. 
4218:Be it a monologue of great importance, a beautiful song, or a seductive lyric, a someone is trying to entrance you with their silver tongues.
4219:Resist their entrancing charms and try to intimidate them instead!
4220:[Demon]Listen attentively, give praise, and part ways as friends.
4221:[Magic user or mysticism]Defend yourself by the strength of your spirit.
4222:You fail. Your mind feels muddled and your spirit cursed.
4223:A demon is approaching you aggressively.
4224:Try intimidation!
4225:[Strength]Stand firm and do not let them enter your territory.
4226:[Magic user]Defend yourself by the strength of your spirit.
4227:You are assailed by the unliving!
4228:[Unliving]Spread your unliving flesh or scent on your allies so your kin will think you're all friends.
4229:Your elven child will not be deemed adult amongst its elven kin for many decades yet, but they have reached the time of growth. {}{}{}{}As such, they will undergo the croppings: a coming-of-age ceremony.{}{}{}{}But this path is never easy. You must choose what journey the young one will take before, gods willing, they may return to you as an adult.{}{}{}{}{}{}
4230:[Magic users or loyalty and mysticism] You either know enough about magic to try and teach even an elven child, or you are friends with the Woodlandkin as so you can ask their guidance so that the youth may become an elven magic user.
4231:[Strength and perception] The child is strong, perhaps it will grow to become a fighter.
4232:Teach the elven child some good old trade. 
4233:[Chance] Elves are forever bound to the forest, allow your child to transform into a forest demon, even if the result is unsure.
4234:The weaves of magic are natural to all elves, yet the path of the magic user is wrought with dark dangers, especially for an elven child raised away from their own kind.  They may not return to you or their path may not lead to what you seek.{}{}{}{}[To pursue rare classes, the child will often need a high stat in the appropriate field (exact numbers vary) like strength for warriors etc. as well as chance. Improving the luck attribute may also help in this.]{}{}
4235:Begin the trials for a mage.
4236:Go back to the choices.
4237:Begin the trials for a druid.
4238:Your elven youth was clearly destined to walk the mystical path as they return to you as a mage.{}{}{}{}The trials were tough and they are not as strong as a fully-fledged adult yet, but in time, surely, they will become great!
4239:Rejoice!
4240:The child returns an elven druid. And while they are now often at odds with village life, they remain loyal to the gods and their chosen family.
4241:Your elven youth was clearly not destined to walk the path of mage, at least not yet. But they received some training, and in all likelihood they still outrank most non-elven magic users, or that is what they tell you.{}{}{}{}
4242:The child entered their trials but the darkness that comes with learning magic proved too strong.{}{}{}{}The youngster falls, their skin turns grey, their veins black, and soon, madness takes their mind. {}{}
4243:Try to make their last days comfortable. There is nothing more to do.
4244:Just as you thought the child gone, they return to you, changed but no longer torn by the darkness - a shadow elf. 
4245:Welcome them back to the fold!
4246:The trials to become a worker are often the safest, but for an elven child the call of their own kin may prove strong when they are told to perform mundane tasks. {}{}{}{}Still, it is a worthwhile journey and should be taken with pride.
4247:Begin the trials for a gatherer.
4248:Begin the trials for a craftsman.
4249:The elven youth sets out obediently to perform their trials, but they never return to you.{}{}{}{}Many years later, you receive word that their journey took them to faraway lands and they hope to return soon, but in elven time, so it may not be in your lifetime.{}{}
4250:Rejoice at their wellbeing, but mourn the loss of their kinship.
4251:The trials are successful and the elven child grows into a youth under your watchful eye.
4252:The trials for a fighter are tough and dangerous. The child must prove their mantle in the wild and hold its own against stronger challengers. 
4253:Begin the trials.
4254:The trials of the warrior proved too hard and the child perished.
4255:The child does not do well in their trials. They return to you rugged and depressed, whispering of blood and rape. {}{}{}{}They were clearly strengthened by whatever happened, but their mind and soul remain scarred. 
4256:Rejoice at their safe return.
4257:Your elven child was due to become adult, at least by your mortal count, but it quickly became apparent they were never elven in the first place, but rather a forest creature disguised by a spell. {}{}{}{}
4258:See the child's true nature.
4259:The child heard the call of the wild and disappeared in the forest for a time, only to return a feral.
4260:The child becomes a forest fairy and returns home to you, changed but ever loyal.
4261:The child becomes a vily and returns home to you, changed but ever loyal.
4262:The child becomes an eldercone and returns home to you, changed but ever loyal.
4263:The child returns a banished elven druid. And while they are now often at odds with village life, they remain loyal to the gods and their chosen family.

4265:Your dwarven child is about to become an adult, at least by how mortals count the years. As such, they will undergo the croppings: a coming-of-age ceremony.{}{}{}{}But the path is never easy. You must now choose what journey the young one will take before, gods willing, they may return to you as an adult.{}{}{}{}{}{}
4266:[Dwarf or loyalty and male] Guide your child to your kin and ask them for training. There is a risk that the child will stay with their dwarven kin, but if they decide to return to you, they will surely be stronger for it.
4267:Teach the child a good old trade. 
4268:[Chance] Your child seems odd, allow chance to guide their fate.
4269:You come to the dwarven town and your young one is taken in for the trials of stone and metal. {}{}{}{}[To pursue rare classes, the child will often need a high stat in the appropriate field (exact numbers vary) like strength for warriors etc. as well as chance. Improving the luck attribute may also help in this.]{}{}
4270:[Luck] Attempt the trial for a runemaster, knowing it may mean your child will remain with the dwarves for centuries to come. [Chance of loss, very high]
4271:[Crafting] Have the child train to become a smith.
4272:Train to become a warrior.
4273:Stay safe and teach the child some good old trade. 
4274:By the will of stone and metal, your dwarven child proved to be a prodigy and has become one of the youngest fully-fledged smiths, especially for one raised away from dwarven cities.
4275:By the will of stone and metal, your dwarven child proved to be a talented labourer, far surpassing their peers.{}{}
4276:The child decided to remain with their own kin. 
4277:Accept their choice.
4278:The trials to become a worker are often the safest, but for a dwarven child, the call of their own kin may prove strong when they begin to mature.{}{}{}{}Still, it is a worthwhile journey and should be taken with pride.{}{}
4279:Begin the trials for a smith.
4280:The dwarven child did indeed grow into a strong youth, but the call of stone and metal proved too strong to ignore, and they left you to be with their dwarven kin. 
4281:The trials are successful and the dwarven child grows into a youth under your watchful eye.
4282:By the will of stone and metal, your dwarven child proved to be a talented warmaster.
4283:The child does not do well in their trials. They return to you ragged and depressed, whispering of blood and rape. {}{}{}{}They become a labourer, but even in that they remain weak.{}{}
4284:Your dwarven child was due to become adult, at least by your mortal count, but it quickly became apparent they were never dwarven in the first place, but rather a creature of stone hidden by a spell!{}{}
4285:The child becomes a rocker and returns home to you, changed but ever loyal.{}{}{}{}In a few decades, it will become a rock troll.{}{}
4286:The child becomes a lava rocker and returns home to you, changed but ever loyal.{}{}{}{}In a few decades, it will become a lava troll.{}{}
4287:By the will of the stone and metal, your dwarven child proved to be a prodigy and has become one of the youngest runemasters ever recorded in dwarven memory.
4288:The trials proved too much, perhaps their bond to the non-dwarven gods interfered with the sacred rites of passage. The child matures but perishes from the shame.
4289:Mourn their passing.
4290:By the will of stone and metal, your dwarven child proved to be a prodigy and has become one of the youngest smiths, especially for one raised away from dwarven cities.
4291:You suddenly feel the winds of mystical powers surround you and you know you are caught in some ritual!
4292:Fight back in the spirit world!
4293:Your orc child is about to become an adult. As such, they will undergo the croppings: a coming-of-age ceremony.{}{}{}{}But the path is never easy. You must now choose what journey the young one will take before, gods willing, they may return to you as an adult.{}{}{}{}{}{}

4296:[Witch]Teach the child the dark path of witchcraft.

4301:[Mysticism] Send your child on the dark path of witchery.

4304:The orcs deem your child useless, but the youth grows into a skilled crafter.{}{}
4305:The trials to become a worker are often the safest, but for an orc child this may not be an easy path to accept.{}{}

4308:The orc child learns to become a worker, but they seem to resent you for it.
4309:The orc child learns to become a worker,  but they seem to resent you for it.
4310:The orc child proves their worth as a warrior, but their path was difficult and left scars.

4332:[Magic user] Attack them spiritually.
4333:The unliving are destroyed and so you should have some peace, for now.
4334:You find a demon nest, which in itself is an oddity. Clearly something drives these demons to congregate here and roam the territory.{}{}

4336:The nest lies destroyed and so you should have some peace, for now.

4463:The trader's stalls stand open for you but we trade in stone, unless you have children, we accept those too.{}{}
4464:'You leave now.'
4465:You find a place hidden from plain sight, and within you spot ice demons congregating. {}{}{}{}It is hard to call it a settlement, but it's likely as close as they get to one.{}{}
4466:Try to speak to them.
4467:You find a place hidden from plain sight, and within you spot ice demons congregating. {}{}{}{}It is hard to call it a settlement, but it's likely as close as they get to one. They spot you and attack!{}{}

4469:The ice demons defeat you and take a life as payment for your attack.

4472:One of the ice monuments opens for you. Enter.
4473:One of the ice demons offers to cleanse your curses. Go to them.
4474:An icicle follows you everywhere, and you think it means to stay with you if you let it. Leave the town to see if it comes with you.
4475:A dziad mroz sits in the centre, his body half submerged into the ice floor:{}{}{}{}'You have proven yourself sturdy. I am interested to learn more. One of my grandchildren, a sniezynka, will join you, and one of yours will become ice. Thus we can both learn of each other. Just do not give me your chosen one, for the gods would not be happy with me. Agreed?'{}{}{}{}
4476:Yes, accept.
4477:Politely decline.
4478:A dziad mroz sits in the centre, his body half submerged into the ice floor:{}{}{}{}'You have proven yourself sturdy. I am interested to learn more. One of my grandchildren, a sniezynka, will join you, and one of yours will become ice. Thus we can both learn of each other. Agreed?'{}{}

4481:Fight with spirit.
4482:You defeat the ice demons.{}{}
4483:The ice demons defeat you and feast on your blood and life essence before you manage to escape.
4484:Your spirit was stronger. The demons perish.
4485:You see before you the ruins of an old city, covered in ice so clear that it looks almost like glass. An old sign hangs at the gate: {}{}{}{}'Ye who come here desire not the treasures within. Turn away, for thy souls will be at peril!'{}{}{}{}There are classically foreboding humanoid skulls scattered around too. 
4486:[Zerca]Look for any signs that may show what this place is.
4487:Barge in with no care for details. [Skip Story]
4488:You look closer at the gates and consider the wording of the warning, and you find symbolism of the long-lost kingdom of Kral.
4489:Try to recall details about this kingdom.
4490:Focus only on what may be relevant here.
4491:This was one of the first human kingdoms to rise after the Darkness was beaten and the Awakening came. It promised renewed glory for mankind.{}{}{}{}But instead of flourishing, within a year, it fell into terrible ruin.
4492:The ruler, King Kral'Skra, was said to be a magnificent man who promised to deliver true prosperity to mankind. {}{}{}{}But there were also rumours that he scorned the gods and thought himself divine. Still, his land prospered until its sudden demise. Looking at these ruins, here in the ice plain, perhaps the city simply fell to the Shattering and its effect on this world?
4493:You enter the ruins and find them surprisingly warm. The ice you previously spotted is indeed more like glass, as it is hard and slippery, but not wet or as cold as you'd expect it to be. {}{}{}{}You also spot a glimmer of light coming from the remains of a tower. {}{}
4494:Explore the tower carefully.
4495:Charge in with weapons drawn!
4496:You enter a large chamber that was surely a great hall once, or perhaps a ballroom.{}{}{}{}There are frozen chandeliers, tables set up with silverware, granite floors, and ornate columns.{}{}{}{}There are also mirrors and paintings on the walls, but the mirrors are shattered, and the paintings are torn where the king's face should be.{}{}{}{}A golden throne is submerged in the odd glass, and atop it sits a lone figure, turned away from you.
4497:Speak to him.
4498:Tell him to talk fast if he wishes to speak at all. [Skip Story]
4499:The person turns to you. He is a withered husk of a once-great man, wearing a crooked golden crown and a metal mask over his face. His voice is loud and harsh:{}{}{}{}'I smell the life force on you. It sickens me to the bones. Have you come to admire my kingdom, or praise my greatness? No? Well, you are too late, it is all gone...'
4500:[Zerca]This is clearly King Kral'Skra. Address him as such and ask what has befallen his once-great kingdom.
4501:Ask him why he sits here alone.
4502:'A learned one? How rare. When I rebuilt mankind's greatness, we had scholars once more. Now, the earth shatters ever more, the light, no doubt brought by the meddling of those idiotic gods...a mere priest holds tatters of great knowledge...'
4503:Wait to listen to more of his story.
4504:Tell him that if he calls your gods idiotic once more, you will teach him a lesson!
4505:Say that you agree about the gods. Even though you are forced to do their bidding, you dislike their constant meddling.
4506:'What happened, you ask? THEY happened. I was strong, I had beauty, wisdom, and the love of my people. But the gods did not like it, no. {}{}{}{}They made my kingdom rot, rough betrayal, and misery, and in the end, on my deathbed, I was cursed, my face torn from me and this body trapped in this glass ruin forever. I cannot touch anything, I cannot leave, and I cannot even look into the mirror, damn them!'
4507:'Bah, a servant of our tormentors. Did they promise you riches, make you their pet chosen? {}{}{}{}It is they who made me like this, you know? I was a king, a great one, too great for them as I renounced their deeds and pushed mankind. But they got angry, cursed me. I was powerful, so they made my kingdom fall. I was loved, so they made my people betray me. And I was beautiful, so they carved out my face and attached it to a demon!'
4508:Accept his tale and tell him it is a terrible fate indeed.
4509:Question his story. You do not think your gods would be so petty. He must have done more to anger them.
4510:'Bah, yes, you know my pain, then!{}{}{}{}It is they who made me like this, you know? I was a king, a great one, too great for them as I renounced their deeds and pushed mankind. But they got angry, cursed me. I was powerful, so they made my kingdom fall. I was loved, so they made my people betray me. And I was beautiful, so they carved out my face and attached it to a demon!'
4511:'I sit here because I am bound by this glass prison, doomed by those idiotic gods that could not stand my greatness!'
4512:'Yes. Not that I require validation of mere minions, for I am a king.{}{}{}{}Since you empathise with my predicament, will you attempt to free me from these bonds?'{}{}
4513:Ask why you should.
4514:Yes, agree.
4515:'The impudence! You come to face a king and speak as if you were an equal. And to question MY word.{}{}{}{}If you do not believe me, go, seek out the demon wearing my face, and the creature will tell you I am right.'
4516:So trust a demon or an unliving, cursed king. Tell him you do not have time for this, and he'd best move away while you loot his ruins!
4517:Ask why you should bother at all.
4518:'HA! You amuse me. Please try to take my belongings, and do let me know how you broke through the cursed ice.{}{}{}{}I grow weary of your company and your state of living irritates me. I think I should kill you.'
4519:Right. So, if there is a way to break this curse, you can have the things and he can be free?
4520:'I suppose I do sense in you an annoying essence of power. You may be just the minions I need to get rid of this wretched curse. If you do, all that lies here under the glass ice will be yours.'
4521:No. Leave.
4522:'Good. As I said, my magnificent visage was placed upon the disfigured body of a lowly demon to mock me. I believe that once you retrieve my face, I will be whole and will break free of this curse. I have marked the creature's lair for you.'
4523:Nod and say you will be back with the face.
4524:'You enter my abode and barge in as if it is yours - impudent. Still, I may have need of you. I was cursed by your damned gods, and I need one of your stature to track down a demon that wears my face and bring it here. In return, once this cursed ice dissolves, you can take what you like from here.'
4525:You slay the creature and his unliving servants, but soon you see his reflection in the broken mirrors, laughing at you.{}{}{}{}The ruins remain covered in glass, so you are not able to loot anything other than the corpses. {}{}
4526:[Shaman]You sense a soul has lingered here, and as shaman, you can pull it towards you so it becomes a companion. 
4527:You are badly beaten, cursed, and driven out of the ruins. If you try to return, you cannot enter.
4528:You find an old graveyard engulfed by low-hanging black mist. It does not seem dangerous now, but you know this could change at any moment.{}{}{}{}This is where the Glass King said a demon wearing his face resides. 
4529:Search for it.
4530:As you move between the gravestones, you notice a young boy skulking in the mist, watching you. {}{}{}{}The boy has wolf's fur on his back, oddly long fingers, and crooked legs. It could be a demon. {}{}{}{}You also spot, under the fur, a terrifyingly beautiful male face staring at you with a nasty grin.
4531:[Demon or Magic user]This is a cursed child, not a demon. Speak to him and ask if he is all alone here.
4532:Ask the creature to come out and talk to you.
4533:[Shadow elf or mroki]You sense the presence of shadowkin here. They will likely defend this creature if you attack. Speak to the odd child.
4534:The child shrieks and the black mist rises, revealing a mroki!
4535:The child steps a bit closer: {}{}{}{}'I...?I have friends, so you best keep away! If you come near me, my back-face will eat you, yeah!'
4536:[Child]Say you'd like to play with him.
4537:Tell the boy you are not here to hurt him. You just want to ask him about the back-face. Does he know how he got it?
4538:'Play, oh yes!' He claps his hands and the children run off and play for a short time. {}{}{}{}When they return, he speaks again:{}{}{}{}'Oh, thank you, that was very nice.'
4539:Ask if he'd like to come with you and play more.
4540:Ask if he knows anything more about the face on his back. Is there a way to take it away?
4541:'Oh, I'd like that very much, but I can't. My father did a bad thing and then this lady put me here and said I will play with the shadows and live forever, but I can never leave this place.'
4542:Who is his father and what bad thing did he do?
4543:'I don't know, really. But he was bad and a pretty lady came and said to him that he must stop, or else I will pay a price with him, because of some old deal he made. {}{}{}{}He said he will do as he wishes. My father is the greatest king, you see. But then, later, when he died, I was brought here and the back-face grew on me and it eats bad people.'
4544:Has he ever tried to leave?
4545:'Yes, it hurts very bad and the shadows say I will die if I leave.'
4546:'No. It lives on my back and the shadows say that if I try to take it off or leave here, I will die.'
4547:[Magic user]Examine the child.
4548:Go back to the Glass King and tell him that killing the child, even if it is a demon, is not to your liking.
4549:You sense that he is cursed by a power beyond your reach. It almost feels divine.
4550:The child is defended by shadowkin, but you defeat them and kill the odd youngster.{}{}
4551:Carve the face off his body and take it back to the Glass King.
4552:Take the whole body back to the Glass King for your reward.
4553:The child is defended by shadowkin and after they defeat you, the entire place disappears in darkness.
4554:You leave the cemetery and the glass ruins appear before you. The king stands in the threshold this time and watches you, then looks down at the bloody face you carry:{}{}{}{}'You got it. Good. Hand it over, and my curse will be broken and we shall all get what we are owed!'
4555:Hand over the face.
4556:You walk away and are about to leave the cemetery when you see a reflection of the king in a puddle:{}{}{}{}'Have you got my face yet?' {}{}{}{}The child plays in the background, and the king seems keen to ignore it.
4557:Ask if he knows that taking the face means killing this child. And also ask if this is his son.
4558:'My son? Do not be ridiculous. It may look like him, but it is another of your god's fiends here to torment me.{}{}{}{}Now kill it, bring me back the face, and get your just reward!'
4559:Convince him that even if this boy is not his, which you think he may be, killing the child is wrong. He should at least speak to the boy. 
4560:Agree and attack the boy.
4561:'I...I don't want to look at him. If you are right, then I am the one who did it? to my own son?'
4562:What did he do, really? Boasting about one's power is hardly reason for such a heavy curse from the gods.
4563:Nod and say this is none of your business, but you do want to see it resolved.
4564:The boy walks over to you and the king looks into his face. A single glass tear drops from underneath the king's mask. {}{}{}{}'Please, leave him be. Do not harm him. I know how to break the curse, give you your reward, and perhaps release the child too. Come find me.'
4565:Agree and leave this place. 
4566:'I allowed my pride to overshadow my duty. I let darkness into my home without knowing it. I made pacts with creatures and schemed to destroy the gods? There, I finally said it out loud. It feels oddly good.'
4567:What about the boy?
4568:'I care little for your morals. Now, do what you were sent to do, or leave. I no longer care which one you choose.'{}{}{}{}The reflection dissolves and the puddle becomes water again.
4569:Attack the child.
4570:Leave this place. There is nothing you can do here.
4571:Kral'Skra takes the bloody face from you and removes his mask, revealing the bare bones and dried flesh underneath. He then attaches the face while whispering an incantation. True enough, you see the glass around you melt away and the king become flesh again.
4572:Bow.
4573:Ask for your reward.
4574:Kral'Skra turns to you, his visage a thing of supreme beauty indeed. But as he is about to speak and rejoice at his victory, the face melts away once more and the glass returns, slowly covering everything.
4575:Quickly grab what you can before it is unreachable.
4576:Hand over the body.
4577:'What, what is this? no, no! My son, my son, NO! He was no demon. I always told myself it was a trick, but it is not, it is him? '
4578:Say that what is done is done. At least he is free. 
4579:Apologise and insist that he told you to do it.
4580:Say that whether the boy was a child or a demon, what does it matter? Both were lives that would be taken for the king's gain and yours. Time to pay the reward.
4581:You take what you can and move away. The once-more-unliving king cries out: {}{}{}{}'Why, why didn't it work? Damn your petty gods!'
4582:Leave him be before he turns his attention to you.
4583:'I said so, yes, but I did not mean this?'{}{}{}{}The glass turns black and trembles, and the king takes his son's body into his hands, cradling the boy in despair. 
4584:Try to leave quietly.
4585:The child steps a bit closer: {}{}{}{}'I?I have friends, so you best keep away! If you come near me, my back-face will eat you, yeah!'
4586:'Why should I talk to you, eh? You look boring?and I?I have friends, so you best keep away! If you come near me, my back-face will eat you, yeah!'
4587:You back away and escape the now-blackened glass city, but you feel your soul was touched by this dark deed. The chosen feels this burden especially hard.
4588:You back away and leave this cursed city. The black glass around you becomes unstable in many places, so you are able to collect some goods.
4589:You find the glass ruins where Kral'Skra awaits you on his throne. But he is now holding an ornate sword. He turns to you as you enter:{}{}{}{}'I was a fool. But no more. With this sword and my will, strike me down. This will destroy the curse, and me and the boy with it, but he shall be free at last.'
4590:Agree to strike him down.
4591:Ask him to tell you the truth of his story.
4592:'Good. Once I am gone, this place will also shatter. If you desire its riches, you must perform a ritual that will slow the destruction. I can give you instructions, but you will have to do it yourself. You will, of course, require one learned in the arts.'
4593:[Magic user]Do the ritual.
4594:Release him without doing the ritual.
4595:You stab the king through the heart as he chants an incantation. His whole body turns to glass and then shatters into smithereens. The ruins begin to shake and collapse.
4596:Grab what you can and run. 
4597:You stab the king through the heart as he chants an incantation. His whole body turns to glass and then shatters into smithereens. The ruins begin to shake and collapse, but your ritual gives you enough time to gather some of the goods.
4598:You stab the king through the heart as he chants an incantation. His whole body turns to glass and then shatters into smithereens. The ruins begin to shake and collapse, and your ritual fails to slow the destruction.
4599:'The truth is a fleeting dream when time stretches as it did for me. Was I a prideful prick who dreamed of toppling the gods, or a visionary thwarted by traditionalists? We will never know. {}{}{}{}I made bad choices, deals, and dirty games. At the height of my fallacy, I challenged Lada and said my own visage is far more divine than her common wiles.'
4600:You will not abide someone being so disrespectful to the gods. Leave him to his damned fate.
4601:'Now, the pretty lady who is not so sublime - was it she who slapped me in the face, or was it her daddy, offended at my impudence, or was it even a priest seeking her favour?{}{}{}{}I do not know. I only know that I did see a golden light come to me as I died, and sweet, sharp words were whispered to me - that which you treasure so will be taken from you, and only when you are reunited will this curse pass its true judgement.' 
4602:How dare he suggest it was the Lady of Love and Harmony that would do such a thing.
4603:Nod in understanding and agree to end this curse for him.
4604:'I have no desire to argue with you. As I said, I never knew which of my many enemies did this to me. Wise ones will likely say I did it to myself. {}{}{}{}I was ready to stay obstinate for eternity, find a way to break this curse and scorn those gods again, but my son? he did not make this choice. He deserves more.'
4605:'Fine. I am a king, and I will not beg, not even for the sake of my poor son.'
4606:For the sake of the boy, agree to break this curse as he asked.
4607:You come across a small hamlet that looks run down and has many odd occult signs scattered around. You hear music and cheering from the barn. Clearly, they are celebrating. A stocky, bald man who introduces himself as the Chief comes out to greet you:{}{}{}{}'Ho, guests! Blessed be Lada. You MUST come and join us, else we both be cursed, eh?'
4608:[Zerca or Magic User]Take a closer look at those occult signs before you decide.
4609:Join the festivities. 
4610:Join the festivities and offer some food to the family.
4611:Politely refuse their hospitality.
4612:A happy couple is blessed by Lada and on the third day, they find a foundling child in the cabbage patch.
4613:Take the child in as your own.
4614:You dance, drink, eat, and rejoice. You feel ill in the morning, but it wouldn't be a good wedding if you felt well.{}{}{}{}The hosts are overjoyed with your presence, and they even give you a parting gift.{}{}
4615:You dance, drink, eat, and rejoice. You feel ill in the morning, but it wouldn't be a good wedding if you felt well. {}{}{}{}There is a lingering feeling of ill spirits here too, but it may not affect you. The hosts are overjoyed with your presence, and they even give you a parting gift.
4616:Those creatures must have been night demons, because from now on one of you must walk the path of the moon!{}{}
4617:You dance, drink, eat, and rejoice. You feel ill in the morning, but it wouldn't be a good wedding if you felt well. {}{}{}{}There is a lingering feeling of ill spirits here too, or perhaps something darker yet - and you realise now they were feeding off you as you were celebrating. {}{}When you look around now, you see no human revellers - only you in an old wrecked barn.
4618:Get out of here.
4619:They accept your refusal with grace, although they are not happy about it. The laws of hospitality are taken very seriously in Slavya. {}{}{}{}They insist you take food and drink as you depart.
4620:You dance, drink, eat, rejoice, and, well, enjoy the company of folk outside of your own village. You feel ill in the morning, but it wouldn't be a good wedding if you felt well.{}{}{}{}And by the laws of this hamlet, you are now married and your spouse will join you!
4621:Refuse and say it is not your custom. Leave.
4622:There are skulls, bones, and sigils marked in old blood. You suspect that black magic is practised here. This is not a sign of evil in itself, but it can certainly bring misfortune and danger. 
4623:[Magic]No magic is bad for those who walk its divine path. Join the festivities anyway.
4624:Join the festivities anyway.
4625:'You dare disrespect us so!' The Chief calls his people, who take out pitchforks and charge at you!
4626:You dance, drink, eat, rejoice, and, well, enjoy the company of folk outside of your own village. You feel ill in the morning, but it wouldn't be a good wedding if you felt well.{}{}{}{}Sometime after the wedding, you realise that you are expecting a baby!
4627:You defeat them and run off before more come to enforce their odd laws.
4628:'No, you be cursed! May your peckers rot and your children be taken by poludnica. Begone!'
4629:They accept your refusal with grace, although they are not happy about it. The laws of hospitality are taken very seriously in Slavya.{}{}{}{}They insist you take food and drink as you depart.
4630:Your village is attacked by an armed group. Their leader, a bold, bulky man calling himself the Chief, calls out in anger:{}{}{}{}'You refused our hospitality, and this brought bad fortune to our abode. My poor daughter died on her wedding night and became a wicked poludnica. You will pay!'
4631:[Zerca]Use your authority as a priest to calm the man down. Tell him you serve the gods and his actions will only bring him more ill luck!
4632:[Demon]Say that this village is under your domain, and you will curse them yourself if they dare come closer!
4633:'Bah! I shit on your gods!' {}{}The Chief starts to walk towards you, then realises his people are not so sure. They take their caps off and bow to you in apology as they skulk away one by one. The Chief turns red with anger but runs also.
4634:'Shut your filthy mouth and die!'
4635:You kill the fools and hope this is the end of it.
4636:You are badly beaten and owe your lives only to the gods, as one of the assailants recognises you as kin of the chosen, so the group decides it is best not to risk divine anger.{}{}{}{}They take what they can and leave you.
4637:Thank the gods.
4638:A rugged-looking woman stays behind and asks to join you.
4639:Accept.
4640:The ruffians who took your stuff cross your path again!
4641:'Fine, just take what you will and leave us be!'
4642:You are beaten and the group escapes, taking your stuff with them, likely for good this time.{}{}
4643:You travel through the woods and stumble across a lone house, nestled among the trees. {}{}{}{}You feel strong magic emanates from within. You also see signs in many languages telling folk to 'Remain at a distance' and 'Keep your extremities out of one's business'.{}{}{}{}You are aware that folk untrained in magic would not be able to see this place at all. 
4644:Go in closer.
4645:Leave whomever is here alone.
4646:You come closer and see the hut more clearly now. It has extremely large windows on one side, so you can see inside it. There are a lot of books, vials, and scrolls, as well as plants and flowers. An elven figure sits with their back to you, reading, and a silver ball lies on a pedestal nearby.
4647:[Perception or hunter]Sneak up on the elf and attack!
4648:'I have very little expectations from lower forms, and yet surely, even the weakest of magic wielders must be able to read, no?'{}{}{}{}The figure does not rise from their chair, nor do they turn to face you. But you realise the door to the house is merely an illusion, so you could go in if you wished.
4649:[Elf Magic User]Tell them you do not take kindly to being referred to as a lower form, and ask what your kin is doing here, in the realms of darkness, alone?
4650:[Intelligence]Praise the quality of the illusion and the apparent intellect of one who has collected so many books. Ask for any wisdom to be shared.
4651:Say that you did not mean to intrude, but you are curious why an elf would stay in a lone house in the lands of darkness.
4652:[Demon]Trick the elf so you can steal the silver ball. 
4653:Attack this arrogant elf!
4654:You kill the elf and their house begins to disappear, books turn to ash, furniture rots away, and soon it looks like there was never anything but a forest here. You grab a few things before they go, but there is not much.{}{}{}{}The silver ball remains, but it is simply a chunk of mithril. 
4655:The elf finally turns to face you:{}{}{}{}'Oh, my apologies. Your energy is so...?mundanely divine, I did not realise. {}{}{}{}I am here with Anare'th.' They point to the silver ball and continue:{}{}{}{}'So, hardly solitary. We are conducting studies of the shadowkin, seeking a cure to their wretched state.'
4656:Wretched state? Do they mean the taint of darkness that the shadow elves seem to have accepted and even embraced?
4657:Anare'th? The ball?
4658:Nod and ask how their study is going.
4659:You charge in, but quickly realise the elf was not really sitting in that chair. They now stand behind you, and you are assaulted by magic!
4660:Fight back.
4661:Drop some bags and try to run away!
4662:You ask the elf many questions and riddles, and eventually they grow angry enough to blast you with a spell. But you snatch the silver ball without them realising it, and it proves to be made of mithril. {}{}{}{}It also feels like it has some magic, but the farther you move away from the owner, the more the power fades, until the ball is as cold as ice. 
4663:You fail to trick the elf. Some kind of protective spell hits you and forces you to flee.
4664:'One would say all sorts of things when under the filthy influence of pure darkness. We guided humans out of their caves. The least we can do is put in some work for our own degraded kin.'
4665:Nod. Ask about Anare'th - the ball?
4666:[Shadow elf]Tell the stuck-up elf that your kind has embraced the power of darkness and was remade, so you do not need 'saving'.
4667:[Shadow elf]Ask if they have found a way to cure your kind, then. If so, you would like to try it.
4668:'Yes. Anare'th met with this fate while exploring a lingering chasm of darkness, not too far from here. Do watch out for those - the infernal force of change does not do well with us light folk.'
4669:Say that you are sorry to hear this.
4670:Ask about the shadow elves again. Why try to 'cure' them when they seem content?
4671:'Why? You were not the one to release darkness with such ferocity, were you now? No. Those fools are long dead, or unliving as their case may be. {}{}{}{}Anare'th provides vital insight into my research and aids my protection from unwanted guests here too. In any case, I have wasted enough time on this idle chatter.'
4672:'It is progressing at a satisfactory pace. I lack live subjects at times, but eventually, I am sure a method will be found. {}{}{}{}All that was changed can surely be unchanged.'
4673:Ask if they can teach you anything, perhaps.
4674:'If you were not kin, I would require a show of your competence, but let us not waste more of my time. Here, take this, and may it bring you the wisdom you seek. Now please leave me to my work.'{}{}{}{}They bow their head, and a single tear drops from their eye and changes into a crystal for you to absorb.
4675:Absorb the crystal and thus share in the knowledge of your brethren.
4676:'All this anger. It saddens me to see you so. My treatment is yet to be perfected, but do you wish to try it?'
4677:No!
4678:What would it do to you?
4679:'Suit yourself. Now, seeing as you were so rude, you may leave now.'
4680:[Elf]Ask if they can teach you anything, perhaps.
4681:'Results thus far vary. At best, you would revert to your true superior form as a pure elf. This, however, is not guaranteed. You might suffer a violent reaction and be transformed.'{}{}{}{}They look at Anare'th, the ball.
4682:'Suit yourself. Do come back in a few decades, as I am sure I will have better odds for you then.'
4683:'Oh, I suppose you do have the common sense to appreciate your betters, yes. I may spare you a moment of my time. {}{}{}{}I am a seeker of knowledge. It is my task to try to cure the shadowkin of their affliction. It consumes much of my time and energy, and thus leaves none for idle chatter.{}{}{}{}Still, here is a small gift for your silver tongue and sharp wits. Now begone.'
4684:The pain of this 'cure' is unbearable. It is as if every part of your body and soul is being ripped apart and plucked with red-hot tweezers that reach deep, deep within and pull at the dark threads one by one...{}{}{}{}Amazingly, you emerge renewed, clean, and ready to begin your journey afresh!
4685:Look at the elf.
4686:'Fascinating...'{}{}{}{}The elf no longer pays you any attention. They are busy making notes.
4687:The pain of this 'cure' is unbearable. It is as if every part of your body and soul is being ripped apart and plucked with red-hot tweezers that reach deep, deep within and pull at the dark threads one by one...{}{}{}{}You feel the pervasive touch of the light twist you inside out and leave you weaker, light-sick.
4688:The pain of this 'cure' is unbearable. It is as if every part of your body and soul is being ripped apart and plucked with red-hot tweezers that reach deep, deep within and pull at the dark threads one by one...{}{}{}{}You feel the pervasive touch of the light twist you inside out and leave you sick, infused with odd power, but unchanged.
4689:'Oh, I suppose I can spare you a minute, silver tongue. {}{}{}{}I am a seeker of knowledge. It is my task to try to cure the shadowkin of their affliction. It consumes much of my time and energy, and thus leaves none for idle chatter.{}{}{}{}Still, here is a small gift for your silver tongue and sharp wits. Now begone.'
4690:The elf simply points at the door and does not even look up from their book.{}{}
4691:You come across a group of goblins, hard at work over some great contraption.
4692:[Intelligence, Dwarf or Goblin]It looks a little like a catapult. You've read about them. Ask the goblins if you are right.
4693:Ask what they are doing.
4694:'Oi, you gave me a fright.' One of the two female goblins jumps up from reading a book under a tree. {}{}{}{}'Yeah, we're making a catapult, but it isn't just any old thing. It's made from the bones of fallen monsters and metal found in ancient ruins and tools from our forefather and...'{}{}{}{}The other goblins roll their eyes at her, except for one. A bearded, bulky fellow with a bushy beard who sits atop the catapult, covered in bruises and bandages, nods at every word.
4695:Right. So, a catapult. Do they plan to conquer something with it?
4696:'Well, we could, that's the point. With the right calculations, it could conquer anything -- a dragon, even!'{}{}{}{}Another goblin holding an abacus and scribbling away at some calculations frowns at her and mumbles, 'Why on earth would you need a catapult to conquer a dragon? That makes no sense.'{}{}{}{}'It was a metaphor, duh.'
4697:Ask if the thing is working.
4698:[Perception or Hunter]They seem very preoccupied. Try to steal some stuff from them while they argue.
4699:It looks like they are very tired, especially the one with the abacus. Ask if they need any help.
4700:'Not yet,' answers the other female, as she tells the one with the abacus to add a feature as if she already forgot you were standing there. {}{}{}{}A bald goblin with a goatee and a baby on his back speaks up: {}{}{}{}'We're working it. But it's a big thing, and there aren't many of us. You know how many mechanisms have to work right for it to be great? No, you don't, because you aren't making the Fli Catapult, now, are you?'{}{}{}{}He waves a piece of paper with the name on it in front of you.
4701:The paper says Fli. Does he mean Fly?
4702:It looks big. How far will it throw stuff?
4703:The first goblin girl throws up her arms. 'Anyone could call it Fly, but Fli sounds way cooler!{}{}{}{}Now, was there anything you wanted? We are very busy.'{}{}{}{}She points at her book.
4704:The last goblin, who hasn't spoken yet, perks up and pulls up his glasses before speaking:{}{}{}{}'Oh, yeah. I joined this lot late, and I don't ever have time anymore, so I know how you could help if you really want to.'{}{}
4705:Sure. Ask him how.
4706:[Intelligence, Dwarf or Goblin]Ask if you could look at the plans first, perhaps.
4707:'Khax there is our numbers guy and he won't stop working, but Avix is worried he'll burn out. We know a shaman who can brew him a sleeping potion, but we never have time to go. Would you fetch it for us? We will pay.'
4708:Agree to bring the sleeping potion back to them.
4709:'A million miles!' shouts the blonde goblin girl, and the one with the abacus lets out a sigh of disapproval again, mumbling, 'It will most certainly not be a million miles, ridiculous...'{}{}{}{}The wounded goblin atop the catapult perks up. 'It got me way over to where that broken tree is, and even though I have three broken bones, we learnt a few flaws. Every time is better, right, guys?'{}{}{}{}They all nod and smile at their friend.
4710:The one referred to as Khax looks up suspiciously, but the others shrug:{}{}{}{}'Sure. Not the important stuff, but you can look at some of it. Maybe you'll learn something.'
4711:Thank them and have a look, then ask how you can help them.
4712:'Oi, you gave me a fright.' One of the two female goblins jumps up from reading a book under a tree. {}{}{}{}We are making a catapult. It's like a war machine to destroy walls and stuff, but it isn't just any old thing. It's made from the bones of fallen monsters and metal found in ancient ruins and tools from our forefather and...'{}{}{}{}The other goblins roll their eyes at her, except for one. A bearded, bulky fellow with a bushy beard who sits atop the catapult, covered in bruises and bandages, nods at every word.{}{}
4713:Say you will help them out and bring the sleeping potion they need. [Skip Story]
4714:You kill the goblins, but the contraption had some sort of self-destruction spell on it, and it collapses. Still, you can scavenge some goods from it.
4715:Get what you can and leave.
4716:You keep them talking while you snatch what you can, and they never see anything.
4717:They seemed preoccupied, but they notice your trickery:{}{}{}{}'Oi, thieving bastards!'
4718:One of the Fli Catapult goblins, Avix, approaches you as you make your way back to them:{}{}{}{}'Ah, found you, good. The others moved already - secrecy and all that. But we got the potions, so I've come to pay you.'
4719:Take the payment.
4720:Complain that the price was high!
4721:'Here, and thanks again.'
4722:Take the payment and leave.
4723:'Oh, the ghost thing. I forgot he may make you do it. Sorry. We get so busy, we forget things outside. I hope our payment is okay to cover it, since we don't have more.'
4724:You find the cave where you were told to look for a shaman that can give you a sleeping potion for Khax. {}{}
4725:Enter and say that you are here on behalf of those odd goblins.
4726:'Ah, them lot. They go through my supply of exotic coffee beans and the wondrous chocolate that I have shipped across the greyworld especially.'
4727:Across the greyworld? One can transport goods via the spirit realm?
4728:Ask for the potion.
4729:'One cannot. I can. Occasionally.'
4730:'Sure, sure. Well, step on there, face the spirits, feed my ball, and the potion is yours.'
4731:What?
4732:'Well, it isn't free and I don't need stuff. I need energy. I designed this contraption so that when you fight my ghosts, I get what I need. Go on then, I haven't got all day.'
4733:[Shaman]Convince him to do a normal trade.
4734:'Bah, fine. Just pay me then and I'll send the stuff right to them.'
4735:Pay.
4736:'Deal's done, they got their stuff already. Now, off you go, I have my own work.'{}{}{}{}He walks away deeper into the cave.
4737:'Ouch, they beat you good. But my contraption is well fed, so I sent the potion to those Fli lot already. And here, something for your troubles too, seeing as you got hurt and all. Now, bye.'{}{}{}{}He walks away deeper into the cave.
4738:'Well done, I have all the energy I need for now. And here, a little extra for your troubles. I sent the potion to those Fli lot already. Now, bye.'{}{}{}{}He walks away deeper into the cave.
4739:'Nah, no need for crap.'
4740:Do the spirit fight.
4741:A trader caravan approaches:{}{}{}{}'Hey there, fellow travellers, I am Vanero, a travelling salesman like no other. I have for you a rare treat: robes weaved from the most delicate spider silk!'
4742:Spider silk?
4743:Ask to see the wares.
4744:'Yes, in times of old, one could harvest spider silk freely and weave the most wonderful clothes from it. Alas, a long-term effect of the darkness changed our dear spiders, and now their silk is too rare to harvest reliably, but I found a stash of it and had it crafted into these lovely robes. Please note that you will not be able to salvage the silk - the weaving technique is such that it can only be used once.'
4745:'With such exotic stock, I can assure you that you'll get at least a strong robe, perhaps even rare if you are lucky. I will match the design for you once you pay me. Unorthodox, I know, but take it or leave it - I have many clients.'
4746:Pay for a robe.
4747:Pay for a chance of up to three robes.
4748:You kill the traders, but some got away during the conflict, and they must have taken those rare robes with them.
4749:You are badly beaten and forced to flee and abandon some goods.
4750:You find a young girl crying out for help. She notices you and looks up with hope.
4751:Approach her and ask what is wrong.
4752:'I am Suri, and I am looking for the bad men who killed my family. Momma was carrying babies, and my sisters too, but all were killed and sliced and burned after, so I don't even have bodies to mourn. The men went that way, but I am too small to kill them myself. Will you help me, please?'
4753:Offer her a place by your side instead. 
4754:Agree to help her get revenge.
4755:You notice that her robes look very similar to those worn by Vanero, the trader you killed. Ask if those are the folk she means.
4756:'No, I will find the men and die if I have to, but I will not rest in peace. I have a family to go after. They are not you.'
4757:She does not speak like a child. Ask her how old she is.
4758:'Older than it seems, probably. Will you help or not? They gain time as we stand here.'
4759:'You did it! I am sad that I did not witness the killing, but I thought I smelled their blood on you. I am glad my senses were true. {}{}{}{}Here, a reward for what you did. I will go now and join some of my family who survived.'
4760:Accept her reward and wish her well.
4761:The girl crouches down, her body convulses and twists, and a spider comes out from under her. {}{}{}{}The spider crawls to you as a pet.
4762:Take it and go.
4763:Ask her what she is.
4764:[Beast or bloodtracker]Tell her she masked her smell well, but now you are sure -- she is no human, is she?
4765:'It does not matter. I am not like you, but you are not my enemy. Those men, they were evil. I will speak to my kind and your deed will be remembered. {}{}{}{}Now I leave.'
4766:The girl nods and then sheds her human flesh to reveal a spider. She speaks, her voice now distorted but no less eloquent:{}{}{}{}'Yes, you are like us, awakened. I wear the manflesh when I need to. You have gained our respect, so when you find our hives, this will be remembered - unless you go on to kill our kind, of course.'
4767:Nod in gratitude and leave.
4768:Ask if the family those men killed was actually a nest of spiders.
4769:Ask her to join you.
4770:'Yes, they butchered our queen and her daughters, for she was able to weave spider silk but refused to give it to them. The silk, you see, is used to coddle our young, and without it they do not survive. But the men did not care. They killed the queen and took all the silk, so all the young died soon after too. I must go now. Farewell.'
4771:Say how sorry you are for her loss and wish her better fortune in the future. 
4772:'Good. I will show you where they are, and I will follow you to see revenge done!'
4773:'Yes, you proved trustworthy, and those gods of yours seem to watch over you. I will come.'
4774:The group that Suri leads you to is none other than the spider silk traders you dealt with before. {}{}{}{}And after your failed attempt to kill them, they do not look happy to see you.
4775:'A family? What? Oh...?oh no.'{}{}{}{}He takes out an artefact and speaks an incantation to reveal one's true form, then shouts:{}{}{}{}'Show yourself, filthy fiend!'{}{}{}{}You see the girl who was following you, but her body now twists and turns as she sheds slabs of flesh and reveals a spider form. She keeps back but hisses at him.
4776:Ask them what is going on.
4777:Attack the men.
4778:Attack the spider.
4779:Say that you will not get involved in this matter and leave them.
4780:The group that Suri leads you to is none other than the spider silk traders you dealt with before. {}{}{}{}Vanero walks over:{}{}{}{}'Back again? I am afraid we do not have more robes yet.'
4781:Ask them about the family they killed.
4782:'We did kill a nest of spiders. Those nasty beasts are a bloodsucking menace, to be sure. Killed many of our men before. Surely you also clear such nests?'
4783:Admit that you do and look to the spider. 
4784:Say that you do no such thing and look to the spider.
4785:Suri speaks, her voice more distorted but still eloquent:{}{}{}{}'I care not if you kill unthinking beasts. We kill and eat also. But mine was no mere nest. We are awakened. We pleaded for the lives of our children, and you laughed as you took the silk, slaughtered us, and condemned the young to a slow death!'
4786:Try to establish a dialogue between the two. Perhaps a compromise can be reached.
4787:The men did not fully realise that the beasts were truly different. And Suri agreed that her kind does hunt humans, so it is not entirely without reason to retaliate brutally. {}{}{}{}The traders pay the spider compensation, and the two parties agree not to cross each other's paths in the future. They both leave you a gift as thanks for your role in this.
4788:Thank them both for this compromise and leave.
4789:You kill the spider and her minions, and the traders look relieved:{}{}{}{}'Filthy beasts, using trickery to get us. Bah. Thank you for helping. Now we must leave, but here, a gift. May Stribog's grace guide your path.'
4790:There is no way to make peace between them. Suri is ready to attack and so are the traders.
4791:You kill the traders, although some of them escape during the chaos. Suri bows before you:{}{}{}{}'Thank you. I was not sure you would still stand with me after you knew I was not of your own kind. Here is my gift to you. Treat them well.'
4792:Ask for Suri to join you instead.
4793:Accept her gift.
4794:She crouches down, her body convulses and twists, and a spider comes out from under her. {}{}{}{}The spider crawls to you as a pet.
4795:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. You do not know how the conflict was resolved once you left.
4796:You kill the traders, although some of them escape during the chaos. Suri bows before you:{}{}{}{}'Thank you. I was not sure you would do it. Please take my pet as thanks.'
4797:[Beast]Say that she masked her smell well until now. Ask if the family those men killed was actually a nest of spiders.
4798:Attack the filthy beast that made you kill humans!
4799:You kill the spider and her minions too.
4800:Gather what is left and leave.
4801:You run and the girl does not follow. You only see that she goes after the traders on her own. 
4802:Welcome her and leave together.
4803:You come across a small hamlet and see a group of people huddled around a young girl and holding her hand. They are speaking to her in comforting tones while a tall, imposing man holding a crossbow aims at the child's head.{}{}{}{}The people look sad, but they are not trying to stop him.
4804:Intervene and ask what is going on here.
4805:Not your problem, leave.
4806:The people look too scared to talk, but the man turns to you. His gaze is tired but sharp, and you see great sadness in his eyes:{}{}{}{}'I have travelled far, sought every answer, tried every cure. But this child -my child - she is possessed by evil spirits from birth. It killed her mother and brother. Other people have died in this village too, which was once a booming place. They protect her, it is kind...but what I am about to do is kinder.'
4807:[Elf Magic User]Ask him to allow you to examine the child first. Perhaps you can find an answer.
4808:[Shaman]If this is any type of spirit possession, you would know. Ask to examine the girl.
4809:[Magic user]Ask him to allow you to examine this child first. Perhaps you can find an answer.
4810:Ask him to tell you more.
4811:Stop him. Killing a child is wrong. Attack!
4812:Step back and accept his decision. 
4813:'A witch cursed my wife as we waited for our daughter to arrive. When the child came, we knew something was wrong. Then misfortune and death came to our home. When our son died and my wife got ill, I left to search for a cure. Witches, zercas, even damned ghosts, none could help. {}{}{}{}I know now that only death will soothe my daughter's soul and save what is left of my home.'{}{}
4814:[Magic user and Elf]Ask him to allow you to examine this child first. Perhaps you can find an answer.
4815:[Shaman]Ask him to allow you to examine this child first. Perhaps you can find an answer.
4816:'An elf. I admit, I have not been able to find one of your kind willing to come here and look at my child. They gave me books I could not read and spouted wisdom out of their arses! Still, I agree. Take a look.'
4817:Examine the child.
4818:The girl seems perfectly normal at first, but your deeper understanding of the weaves of magic reveals another being, hiding itself within the child's body. {}{}{}{}You can perform a ritual of light that will destroy this unwanted presence, but there is a very real risk that the girl will not survive the ordeal. 
4819:Ask the father if he wants you to do the ritual.
4820:You allow the man to shoot his daughter and he does so, then falls to his knees and cries. {}{}{}{}There is a release of energy from the child's body and the villagers seem to gasp, like people taking in their first breath after being underwater for too long.{}{}{}{}They begin preparations for the burial rites. An elder walks up to you:{}{}{}{}'We thank you for not interfering. This has been hard enough already. Gradny will likely never recover, but he did what had to be done. You have our thanks, but I would advise you to leave us be, as I am not convinced all of our misfortune is gone just yet.'
4821:Nod and leave this place.
4822:[Magic user]Offer to perform a ritual to try to cleanse this place further.
4823:Gradny looks up, his eyes bloodshot:{}{}{}{}'No, I will have no more witchery here!'{}{}{}{}You get the feeling it may be time to leave.
4824:Sometime after you depart, you realise the ghost of the killed girl has attached itself to you. It is hard to tell if it remains cursed or is now cleansed. It does not speak, but only seeks to follow you if you accept it.
4825:Take the ghost.
4826:No, refuse it.
4827:Alas, whatever curse ailed the girl lingers on, and it has now attached itself to you. The ghost, distraught by this turn of events, disappears, but this does not take away the blemish on your spirit.
4828:Sometime after the events, a group from the hamlet finds you:{}{}{}{}'Stribog guided our path as we searched for you! We were not kind to you before, and it is not our way. You made a hard choice when you allowed us to do what we had to, and we want to tell you that all is well in our home again. Harvests are good, children laugh again. Life is returning to us. Here, accept this as a sign of good fortune for us all!'
4829:Thank them and offer them some food in hospitality.
4830:'You mean, there is a chance? How am I supposed to trust you? I've had witches and wise ones here before, claiming they cured her or saying there is nothing wrong, and the evil came back every time!'
4831:Tell him not to compare you to lesser beings who play with magic. You are of the elder children, and this lies within your reach. Thus, you offer aid, but you will not be offended by a human.
4832:Say that it is not your concern either way. 
4833:The folk look angry at the arrogance of your words, but the man nods:{}{}{}{}'Yes. From all the knowledge I gained over the years, I cannot deny the elves their bond with high magic. And you are all chosen of our gods, so I will take it as a good sign. Please, do it.'
4834:Perform the ritual. 
4835:The ritual is too difficult after all. Attack the man so he does not kill the child!
4836:Say that you changed your mind. Step back and accept his decision. 
4837:'Then leave us be. Witchery is what got us here, and I will have no more of it!'
4838:You cleanse the girl's soul, but alas, her young body does not survive the strain. However, you feel her soul has been released and is free of the burdens it carried in life, although sadly unable to fully move on. {}{}{}{}The ghost seeks to stay with you from now on in gratitude for your deed. 
4839:Release the ghost from any obligation and say that she should stay with her father. 
4840:Accept the ghost's service.
4841:You cleanse the child's body and soul, and whatever evil lingered is gone. The girl is weak, but she will live. The father looks at you with hope:{}{}{}{}'I...I almost killed her. How can I be sure this time it will work? So many things we tried...But no, we will have faith. You walk with the gods and you are elder kin. Thank you. Here, this is all I can pay you with.'
4842:Bow in thanks, then rest and depart.
4843:You cleanse the girl's soul, but alas, her young body does not survive the strain. She dies screaming as her body and soul twist in agony and you sense that she has become a wraith. {}{}{}{}The father cries out: {}{}{}{}'I never should have listened to you witch types! She should have died in peace. Leave us be, now!'
4844:This girl's condition is indeed puzzling. To anyone else it would seem that she is normal, but you sense a spirit residing within, or perhaps even several.{}{}{}{}Spirit possession like this is rare. It would be more typical for such a human to become an unliving corpse or turn into a demon. For some reason, this child is a vessel.{}{}{}{}You can enter the greyworld and battle the spirits there. If you win, you will be able to drag them out. It could, of course, be fatal to the vessel.
4845:Ask the father if he wants you to try.
4846:'Oh, I've had a gobbo shaman here before. The charlatan took our money, extracted a ghost, even showed it to us, but then it all returned!'
4847:Say that it sounds like the shaman did not realise there was more than one spirit possessing this girl -- either that, or he was indeed a fraud. It is not unheard of for your kind to pretend, because everyone assumes you are all shamans. Still, tell the man you are certain of what you see and you will try to help, in the name of Marovit and the cosmic pantheon you serve.
4848:'You do not seem intent on doing this, nor did you ask for compensation. I...I will trust in the will of the gods, who clearly favour you. Please, do your best.'
4849:Begin the spirit fight.
4850:'You call upon the gods, but we will not suffer the whims of witchery and goblin trickery again! Leave us be.'
4851:You examine the girl but see nothing out of the ordinary. You catch a faint glimmer of darkness lingering in her presence, but not enough to call it a curse.{}{}{}{}You could try doing a cleansing ritual, but without any clear target, it likely would not work.
4852:Tell the father of your findings.
4853:'Yes, yes, that is what all of you charlatans said before. I will not have you perform any more witchery here. We've had enough. She's had enough. It is time to put an end to it. At least you were honest, and for that I thank you. Please, leave us be now.'
4854:You kill the man and those who stood by his side. The child, Zloslawa, remains. She looks at you, scared. 
4855:Take the girl with you.
4856:Leave her. You didn't want her dead, but you don't want her bad luck either.
4857:The father cries and thanks you:{}{}{}{}'She is free. That is what I hoped for. Thank you!'
4858:Apart from cats, none of your pets have ever liked Zloslawa much. You'd see them snarl at her or shy away. {}{}{}{}Today, you found all your companions sickly and some dead.
4859:Kill Zloslawa.
4860:All the food that Zloslawa was carrying, and some food that she simply came near, has rotted away.
4861:Surely this will end when she is an adult. Leave.
4862:Zloslawa had nightmares tonight and you all wake up in terror, some carrying a curse upon their spirit.
4863:Zloslawa is sent to bring water, but when you drink it, you all fall terribly ill.
4864:Zloslawa is happy to make you soup. But chance has it that a trickster demon switched your spices with snake venom. Some of you are poisoned from it.
4865:You are going about your day normally when you hear Zloslawa's scream. When you run to find her, you find that one of your people has been struck by lightning, even though there is no storm.
4866:A traveller passes by and tells you a harrowing story of his village:{}{}{}{}'I was away to trade, then I come back and find out my folk adopted this foundling girl, Zloslawa. We should have heeded the name and the red hair, but we did not. {}{}{}{}Calamity has befallen my home. Food rotting away, animals dying, then people...'
4867:What did they do?
4868:'Oh, we are trying to find a wise one, a cure. But I just don't know. I am on my way back and will have to decide. I am sorry - this is not your burden. Would you like to trade before I go?'
4869:Tell him the truth about Zloslawa, her old family, and how you killed them. Admit that perhaps they were right after all and the child should die.
4870:[Magic user]Do not admit that you know the girl, but use your authority to advise them to kill the child. 
4871:Say that you are sorry to hear of their troubles and ask to trade before he leaves.
4872:He looks at you, startled and angry:{}{}{}{}'So you decided to intervene and then simply left the child? If we at least knew what she was, we could have tried to be ready or made an informed decision. Gods damn you and your half-arsed do-goodery!'{}{}{}{}He storms off.
4873:'Thank you so much for wanting to help. I will consider your advice, although it is hard to hear. Here, a small token of my gratitude, for your expertise.{}{}{}{}Would you like to trade?'
4874:No. Wish him well and leave.
4875:Late at night one of your children wakes, trapped in a silent scream. They see before them spirits that are malevolent, angry. Amongst them is the lost soul of Zloslawa, a girl you abandoned to her fate.{}{}{}{}Your own child is transformed into Zloslava and, when asked, she is not aware of any of it, she simply thinks she is yours.
4876:Accept her.
4877:Kill her.
4878:An old man finds his way into your village. He is clearly in pain and complains of a backache. He looks at your homes:{}{}{}{}'I see you are building a home for yourself, good. But you youngsters nowadays don't know how to build properly! These homes will fall down in the blink of an eye, mark my words! It's a shame to see so much effort just wasted.'
4879:If he is so smart, ask him to teach you how to do it better.
4880:Allow him to rest and then ask him to move on.
4881:Share a bit of food with the man before he leaves.
4882:The man leaves, but your food stocks rot away within days and some of you fall ill. Clearly the gods do not like when hospitality laws are broken.
4883:Go back to work.
4884:'This is very kind, yes. You may not know how to build properly, but sit, listen to a few stories from an old man, and maybe you will learn a thing or two from the old days.'
4885:Listen to his tales before he departs.
4886:'And why should I waste my old breath on you, eh? My back aches. I need to get to a healer. I have no time to spare.'
4887:[Healer]Offer to help him with his back in exchange for his wisdom.
4888:Show him you are smart enough to teach.
4889:'Well, I'll be damned to the underworlds! Good as new. As thanks, I'll tell you what's what and how's how. That's not how you use a hammer, and do you call this a proper foundation?'{}{}{}{}The lecture continues for quite a while, but you are indeed learning new things.
4890:Thank him and ask him to stay on.
4891:Thank him and wish him well on his travels.
4892:'Well, you tried and that counts for something, but I gotta say, you are as good a healer as you are a builder. Youth these days...?I better move along now. Good fortune to you. You clearly need it.'
4893:Watch him leave.
4894:'Oh, all right! I'll tell you what's what and how's how. That's not how you use a hammer, and do you call this a proper foundation?'{}{}{}{}The lecture continues for quite a while, but you are indeed learning new things.
4895:You come across a shipwreck and see a female floating atop a raft, clutching a golden treasure chest.{}{}{}{}She calls out to you:{}{}{}{}'Hurry, please, help me!'
4896:Try to get to her through the troubled waters.
4897:Leave her be.
4898:You swim towards her, but the waves are strong and the winds work against you, so you move slowly. As you get closer, you see the girl has an odd greenish complexion. She cries out again:{}{}{}{}'Thank you. The chest, it must be taken to my home, else all my family will die. Please, if something happens to me, even if it looks hopeless, find it and take it there...'
4899:Assure her that you are coming to get her.
4900:The sea suddenly opens up and a kraken appears. The waves push you away and the creature effortlessly grabs the girl and swallows her whole. {}{}{}{}The kraken ignores you, its eyes glimmering gold, as it swims away on the surface, towards the shore.{}{}
4901:Try to track it.
4902:Oh well, bad luck. Search the wreckage and swim away.
4903:You follow the kraken at a safe distance, and you think you know where to search for it once you get to the shore.
4904:Look for it once you are on land. Leave.
4905:Alas, tracking a kraken through the waters proves too hard, and you lose the trail.
4906:You spot the golden-eyed kraken you once tracked. It seems to be coming in and out of a cave on the seashore. {}{}{}{}You hear the cries of a girl from within.
4907:Mark the place on your map.
4908:You come close to the kraken cave and use the land entrance to get a better view of the inside while staying at a safe distance from the beast.{}{}{}{}You see the odd girl who asked for your aid. She is being held by a tentacle, her life slowly squeezed out of her.{}{}{}{}The golden chest lies on the cave's floor. You cannot get the girl without attacking the beast, but you can try to sneak in and take the chest.
4909:Sneak in and take the chest.
4910:[Magic user]Krakens are creatures of magic. Attack it in the spirit realms!
4911:You sneak in and take the chest without the beast noticing. As you get out and examine your treasure, you see a map carved on top. It must lead to this home the girl spoke of. {}{}{}{}The chest does not seem to have a way to open it - no locks, hinges, or other signs of how it works.
4912:[Goblin or dwarf]Figure out a way to open it.
4913:Bash it open and collect the loot.
4914:Take it back 'home' as the girl asked.
4915:You open the chest and find treasure within. You also feel a blast of good energy upon you.{}{}{}{}The chest breaks into pieces, destroying the map forever.
4916:You bash the chest open and hear a desperate cry of lost hope and despair. {}{}Some of what was inside breaks from your impact, but you still find some treasure.{}{}{}{}The chest itself breaks into pieces, destroying the map forever.
4917:You are discovered, badly beaten, and forced to flee, and if you ever return, you find the cave abandoned.
4918:You kill the beast and rescue the girl, who turns out to be a syrin. She collapses unconscious and only manages to whisper:{}{}{}{}'Only home can cure me...'{}{}{}{}When you examine the chest, you see a map carved on top. It must lead to this home the girl spoke of. The chest does not seem to have a way to open it - no locks, hinges, or other signs of how it works.
4919:[Goblin or dwarf]Abandon the girl but take the treasure. Figure out a way to open it.
4920:Leave the syrin to her fate. Bash open the chest and collect the loot.
4921:Take the syrin back 'home' as the girl asked.
4922:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, and if you ever return, you find the cave abandoned.
4923:You find the home that the girl with the golden treasure chest spoke of. {}{}{}{}It is a city built underground, but unlike dwarven dwellings or mines that you may have seen, this one is built atop an underground lake riddled with waterfalls and streams leading in and out of the caves. You spot many eyes watching you: syrin and alkhonost seem the most common, but you also spot rusalkas, befuddlers, and others unknown to you.
4924:Go in and present the golden treasure chest to them. Explain how you came to find it and tell them of the sad fate of the girl caught by the kraken.
4925:Hand them the treasure chest and ask for payment. 
4926:A befuddler walks out of the water to greet you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, the ark. So Seayanna has perished on her quest. These are sad tidings, yet you bring us hope by finishing her task. We thank you.'
4927:Nod and say that it seemed like the right thing to do. Ask what this task was. Why was the chest so important?
4928:Say that you did what you thought was right, but you also hope there is a reward.
4929:'Yes. Here is a token of our thanks. You are also welcome to enter our town to trade and rest. We only ask that you do not show this path to another.'{}{}
4930:Agree to keep their secret and explore the city.
4931:'This place is a haven for creatures like myself who wish to live in peace, away from the temptations of the open world, and far from the prejudices we meet there.{}{}{}{}But we are bound by demon laws, and sooner or later they always call to us. With the ark, we are able to stay cut off, unseen even by those ancient rules and those who uphold them.'
4932:[Demon]Say that you understand, as you have also chosen a different path from your nature. 
4933:Ask to see this city of theirs, if you can.
4934:The city is vast, but it is also wild and unruly. You find some traders, and you can also heal your wounds and curses here.
4935:Heal physical wounds.
4936:Heal mental ailments.
4937:Seek spiritual healing.
4938:Ask to see the witch to remove curses. 
4939:You return to the Haven and are welcome as before. {}{}{}{}The city is vast, but it is also wild and unruly. You find some traders, and you can also heal your wounds and curses here.
4940:'Yes, of course. You chose the way of the young gods. We have heard tales of you. {}{}{}{}It is not a path for everyone. We found ours, although perhaps we should consider your choice more carefully, as you do not seem to need additional trickery to stay free. {}{}{}{}Still. For now, the ark will do, my friend.'
4941:For days now your idol has been acting oddly. Its usual glow of protective power is weak and it simply looks unwell.
4942:Search the village for clues.
4943:[Magic user]Perform a ritual to try to discover what is wrong here.
4944:[Zerca]Ask for divine inspiration and search your books for answers.
4945:[Rat]You can smell your kind here. Dig in and search all the hidey-holes.
4946:You discover rats in your cellars, and when you track them, you see that they have nested under your idol and chewed the divine roots, thus causing the odd 'power outage'. {}{}{}{}It seems several have actually fried themselves while doing it.
4947:Clean it up and kill any that are left. 
4948:You eventually find a nest of rats. They have nested under your idol and chewed the divine roots, thus causing the odd 'power outage'. {}{}{}{}Alas, it took you too long to discover them. The idol takes weeks to heal, causing all sorts of mischief in the meantime.
4949:You discover that one of the rats managed to digest the divine root and still lives. It looks at you, just as shocked as you are, and asks to join your village.
4950:Refuse and chase it away.
4951:A witch hut walks over to you on its chicken leg, and a voice booms from within:{}{}{}{}'I smell sweet darkness clutching your souls. And where there is demand, I bring supply. {}{}{}{}Pay, my dearies, and your curses shall be cured!'
4952:[Witch]Tell her to stop the sales pitch and just give you a rabbit's foot dipped in a virgin's blood under a half moon during harvest. You can do the rest.
4953:[Magic user]Ask for a professional discount, as you only need the facilities and some supplies, and you can manage the rest.
4954:'Bah, right you are, sister. Here, special price for you.'
4955:Pay for one curse.
4956:Pay more to have more than one type of curse removed.
4957:'Hmm, sounds reasonable. You will pay less, my dearie.'
4958:'Which curse?'
4959:Physical.
4960:Mental.
4961:Spirit.
4962:'Goody. Pay up and let's do it.'
4963:A befuddler walks out of the water to greet you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, the ark. And Seayanna still lives. This is wonderful news! Her task is completed, thanks to you, and we can heal her. We thank you.'
4964:Ask if you can see Seayanna once she is awake.
4965:The befuddler leads you to the healers' chamber, where the young syrin is recovering. She wakes and speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'You, you saved me? I did not think anyone would risk the kraken's wrath for me. Thank you!'
4966:[Attractive and male]Tell her it was your pleasure to aid her and that you wish she could perhaps come with you.
4967:Tell her it was the right thing to do and that you are happy she is well. 
4968:'I...well, I admit I have never met one as you...yes, I will come. Go, see our city, I will join you. Just please remember to keep this place a secret from others.'
4969:Accept and go explore the city.
4970:Politely refuse, wish her well, and go explore the city.
4971:'You are kind, very kind. I wish to follow your path from now on, if you will take me. Just please remember to keep this place a secret from others.'
4972:'You are kind, very kind. I shall never forget your deed. I give you my companion. He is a cmuch and will keep you healthy for me. And I give you this piece of jewellery. It was made by the czytlica, deep in the sea. May it serve you well.'
4973:Thank her and go explore the city.
4974:The wreaths did their job, and two of the folk at the party embark on a new path, joined by the gods in union. {}{}{}{}For three days, the village will feast, dance, and celebrate. 
4975:The village is blessed by Lada, and on the third day, they find a foundling child in the cabbage patch.
4976:Your village was visited by the dziody, spirits of the forefathers, and they blessed those who know the paths of magic with greater power. {}{}{}{}The wise ones rejoice, as the approval of the dziody bodes well for you.
4977:You feel the grace of harmony upon you.{}{}{}{}The guests who have come to celebrate with you leave gifts so the gods may bless you all.
4978:A young man emerges from the water carrying one of the wreaths. He is a befuddler, but he says he heard the call of harmony and wishes to join you. 
4979:Accept him.
4980:Allow him to stay and celebrate, but say that the wreath belongs to your guests, so he should leave with them in the morning. 
4981:Storytelling has long been the way to pass on knowledge and tell tales of the gods and their deeds. {}{}{}{}Tonight, your wise ones will face off against your guests to see who can spin the best story.
4982:Young hopefuls weave wreaths intertwined with their own hair and make candles that are put inside. The summer rafts are to swim downriver, and for the lucky ones, true love can be found. 
4983:Make the best wreath you can!
4984:The Kupala Night approaches. The summer solstice is welcomed in celebration of life and fertility. {}{}{}{}There are many ways to celebrate and honour the gods on this night. Folk from other villages have also come to celebrate in the village of the chosen.
4985:Honour harmony.
4986:Honour intellect.
4987:Honour magic.
4988:Honour turmoil.
4989:Honour nature.
4990:Honour light.
4991:The calling up of the dziody, spirits of the forefathers, is an age-old tradition. {}{}
4992:The wreaths were not made well this season and, sadly, sink into the waters. {}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
4993:Continue the celebrations and hope the gods are appeased.
4994:Your stories fell short, while your guests showed great reverence to the gods. {}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
4995:The exchange of stories expands your knowledge, and you feel the gods must be happy with such wonderful tales told in their honour. Your guests are also humbled by your skill and exclaim they now know why you are of the chosen kin. 
4996:Dwarves value the tradition of storytelling, and it turns out that one of the guests who kept to themselves throughout heard your tales:{}{}{}{}'I hears stories of your Svarog and the young gods. But now I heard them truly. I offer my shield and arm to your cause, if ya will have me.'
4997:Politely refuse and suggest it is your opponents who deserve such honour. 
4998:The dziody came but they were in a mood. They did not offer wisdom or stay long. {}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
4999:Your village was visited by the dziody, spirits of the forefathers, and they blessed you with words of wisdom and a glimpse of your destiny. {}{}{}{}The wise ones rejoice, as the approval of the dziody bodes well for you.
5000:A young goblin shaman witnessed your ritual and recognised the reverence you hold for the forefathers. They decide to join your path if you will accept them.
5001:For the gods of turmoil, the only way to celebrate this night is in the ever fate-driven arms of combat. {}{}{}{}You and your guests will wrestle and spar under the fool moon's gaze and then drink together in union. {}{}
5002:The orcs walk the path of turmoil with great vigour, and one decides you are an alpha worth following!
5003:The orc spits at you and walks off, swearing that such dishonour will one day be avenged!
5004:Continue your celebrations.
5005:You did well to show your strength, and the wise ones say it is an omen of good fortune.{}{}{}{}Even bruised, everyone drinks and celebrates together.
5006:As followers of nature, it is your custom to bathe in clear water under the moon to honour the cleansing of the body and the life-giving power of water. {}{}{}{}During this trial, one must submerge entirely and last as long as they can in the cold embrace of the darkness, then re-emerge in the light of the moon. 
5007:The moon is also worshipped by the wolves, and a werewolf joins in the trials. Afterwards it offers to change one of you into its kind so you may truly experience the moon's glory.
5008:Accept and allow one person to be changed. The person will be chosen by the wolf.
5009:You did well to show your devotion to nature and your reverence for water and moon, and the wise ones say it is an omen of good fortune.{}{}{}{}You can now return to the usual libations.
5010:To honour the sun and light as the protective force, as well as the celebration of fertility, couples and friends alike tie their hands with straw and jump over a bonfire while carrying a lit candle in their joined hand to keep this light-bond intact. {}{}{}{}The trick will be to fight off fire spirits that will be called into the fire on this night.
5011:An elf approaches and bows before you: {}{}{}{}'Your reverence for light is commendable. I have been searching for a new path and I wish to follow yours.'
5012:The straw holds fat and the candles remain erect and lit, so the couples will surely be blessed by the gods.{}{}{}{}The village and your guests rejoice. 
5013:You did your best, but your guests proved to be the victors. {}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
5014:You did your best, but you lost control and almost drowned. {}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
5015:The straw breaks and the wax melts. It seems your fire trials are a mess.{}{}{}{}Wise ones worry that this may be a bad sign for the coming harvest, so you make sure to leave extra food as a sacrifice to the gods.
5016:You come across an unusual group of travelers: a huge spider queen who is sitting atop a wagon, several smaller spiders rushing around her, a few bees flying, a zerca, and a human warrior. {}{}{}{}Their heated discussion halts when they see you. They draw weapons and stand ready:{}{}{}{}'Hold! Who goes?' shouts the warrior.
5017:Tell them you are just passing by. Ask if they need assistance. 
5018:They cover the wagon, but you spot a lot of blood bones stashed away. They look at each other. The zerca speaks:{}{}{}{}'You are not one of us, so we do not wish for your help. Please leave us be.'
5019:Try to convince them to tell you more. 
5020:[Friend]Tell them of your friendship with the stingers and ask again if they need your assistance.
5021:[Nature]Say that your domain is nature, so surely they can trust you.
5022:[Intellect]Say that as a zerca, he should respect your domain and know that you will consider their case without prejudice, if possible. They lose nothing by sharing their woes with you, after all.
5023:'Well, I suppose we can share. We were forced out of our nest by humans who took offence at our beliefs. We worship the lady Dievanna, but we see her best reflected as the spider queen. {}{}{}{}The Slavyans felt we were disrespectful. They took our home and burned the young as if they were mere beasts. {}{}{}{}If you truly want to aid us, reclaim our nest. It is rich in blood bones, collected over many years. You can harvest them if you like.'
5024:Ask if they are part of the stingers faction.
5025:Refuse and say that you will not go against the Slavyans for a spider cult. Leave.
5026:'Yes, but only in the same way that you are a Slavyan. We share some beliefs and are kin, but not precisely the same.'
5027:'Well, you surprise me. Thank you. I will mark the spot where our nest lies. Please hurry before they destroy all we have worked so hard for.'
5028:Tell them you'll do your best, and leave.
5029:'Yes, as I suspected. Well, this was a nice waste of time. Let us depart.'
5030:'It is no business of yours, but since we're standing here, we have blood bones to sell, packs of at least ten. We will take weapons and armour in trade.'
5031:You kill the whole lot and find a good supply of blood bones on the cart, although the wagon itself is broken.
5032:You find the cave of the spider cult's nest. There are indeed Slavyan guards posted. 
5033:Ask them if they would consider leaving this place.
5034:Intimidate them into leaving.
5035:[Zerca]Tell them the gods are not happy with their treatment of the spider cult zerca. They do revere the lady Dievanna, after all!
5036:Abandon this quest, and leave.
5037:'I suppose we can leave for a price. You pay us, we go. We do not have the manpower to harvest this nest, and we don't fancy seeing those spider folk again.'
5038:Refuse and attack them!
5039:Refuse and abandon this task.
5040:They pack up and leave, and the spider cult approaches:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, this is truly unexpected. Please harvest as much of the blood bones in these caves as you wish, and visit us again if you can.'
5041:'Oh, yes...?we are sorry, we did not mean to offend the gods!'{}{}{}{}They pack up and leave, and the spider cult approaches:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, this is truly unexpected. Please harvest as much of the blood bones in these caves as you wish, and visit us again if you can.'
5042:'No, beat it!'
5043:You kill the humans and the spider cult approaches:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, this is truly unexpected. Please harvest as much of the blood bones in these caves as you wish, and visit us again if you can.'
5044:You are beaten badly and forced to flee. Later you find the nest burnt to the ground, unsalvageable.
5045:You find the spider cult nest you once helped:{}{}{}{}'Welcome back, friend. You can rest, recruit any folk who'd like to join you, heal toxins, or trade with us.'
5046:Trade. [10 turn cooldown]
5047:Heal toxins.
5048:Recruit spiders, for a price. [Strong Spiders]
5049:Nothing to do here for now. Leave.
5050:'Anything else?'
5051:You wake at night to witness a snake-like movement in the mist. An alabaster, elongated shape slithers towards you slowly, twisting and turning, almost as if figures were hiding underneath its white blanket. {}{}
5052:[Zerca or healer]Consider this carefully before acting.
5053:[Wisdom]Watch them.
5054:Attack this thing!
5055:This is a vaenukois, often referred to by people as a chain of anguish. It is said that they are the souls of those who perished to an awful illness, but, as a wise one, you know that these spirits are actually the Nyia larvae, insect-like creatures who feed on the corpses of the diseased.{}{}{}{}By all accounts, you can extract a potion from these larvae to increase your medical knowledge. Be sure to use your left hand for the extraction.{}{}
5056:Proceed with the extraction.
5057:You squish the odd procession of spirit-like creatures, and they screech and explode with whitish liquid all over you. It has no immediate effect, but you have a feeling that this is no normal liquid, so its effects may come soon.
5058:Get it off and leave.
5059:This is a vaenukois, often referred to by people as a chain of anguish. It is said that they are the souls of those who perished to an awful illness and now they march together to find the underworlds and with it the peace they deserve. {}{}{}{}By all accounts, if you break up this procession, you could gain power!{}{}
5060:Speak to them and guide their path to peace. 
5061:Using your left hand, you carefully separate the right larvae and extract their insides to make the potion. 
5062:Drink up and leave.
5063:It was going well, but you forgot yourself and used your right hand, so the potion made you ill. 
5064:You break up the odd procession and, just as the lore warns, you get stung by the spirits. But, separated from the lot, they now look like insects and their bodies are filled with liquid. 
5065:You break up the odd procession and, just as the lore warns, you get stung by the spirits. But, separated from the lot, they now look like insects and their bodies are filled with liquid. {}{}{}{}You drink it, as the tales say you should, but you only feel ill...
5066:Your village is attacked by creatures of darkness that assail every home with vicious ferocity. 
5067:You stand firm and try to fend them off, but you are few. {}{}{}{}Just as you enter the battle, a man clad in armour, proudly holding a shield in his hand, stands with you, shouting:{}{}{}{}'For The Guard, you shall not win, fiends of darkness!'
5068:You defeat the monsters and the man bows to you:{}{}{}{}'You fought well, friends. Together we defeated yet another creature of the sordid dark.'
5069:Ask him who he is and why he helped.
5070:Thank the man and ask if he will join you.
5071:Thank the man for his aid. 
5072:'I am but one of many. Or at least we were once. We are The Guard, sworn warriors against darkness. We were formed during the Awakening, and although the threat of the dark has diminished, we stay vigilant and fight on.'
5073:[Shadowkin or wisdom]Say that darkness is needed for the world to know balance. It is light that now threatens Thea, after all. 
5074:He frowns:{}{}{}{}'So they say. There are many of The Guard who would disagree and insist that the light remains our ally. Some have even joined this lightbringers calamity freely. {}{}{}{}But our order was created to uphold balance at a time when it was darkness that threatened it. I see that. Others sadly do not.'
5075:Thank the man for his aid and leave.
5076:'Your path is of light or harmony, I sense it. My order has long sworn its allegiance to the same gods. Many of my brothers and sisters have fallen, and I must fight on. Thus, I shall join you. My sword is yours.'
5077:Accept his pledge.
5078:'Your path is of turmoil or magic, and both thread ever so close to darkness. And yet, I must recognise that your pantheon stands for balance, that I must adapt to overcome new dangers. Many of my brothers and sisters have fallen, and I must fight on. Thus, I shall join you. My sword is yours.'
5079:'Your path is of the gods, although your domain of nature or intellect does not inspire me in any way. Still, I value the instinct and reason that guide you and hope they will guide me also to serve the greater good. Many of my brothers and sisters have fallen, and I must fight on. Thus, I shall join you. My sword is yours.'
5080:'You walk the path of the gods, but my service lies elsewhere. Perhaps one day we will meet again. If not, I wish you well in your fight for the gods. But I leave you my trusted steed - may he serve your cause well. Farewell.'
5081:Wish him well and get back to work.
5082:'It was but my duty as part of The Guard to aid those who need it. Perhaps one day we will meet again. If not, I wish you well in your fight for the gods. But I leave you my trusted steed - may he serve your cause well. Farewell.'
5083:The beasts beat you badly, but eventually they are chased away by the stranger. He is wounded, but alive:{}{}{}{}'You should not leave your homes so poorly protected. Fiends of the dark spread their influence when people show weakness like this.'{}{}{}{}He walks away without looking back.
5084:Get back to work and tend to your wounds.
5085:A veteran warrior visits your village and offers his services as a trainer: {}{}{}{}'I can teach those who are willing, but I am not cheap. Or, if one of you is strong enough and shows me your physical prowess, I may teach you a trick or two for free, as I am always looking for talent.'
5086:Pay to improve strength.
5087:Pay to improve perception.
5088:Pay to increase max physical health.
5089:[Strength]Show him your strength.
5090:'Yes, I see your talent. Let us begin.'{}{}{}{}The warrior stays with you for a time and puts you through rigorous training before moving on. 
5091:You hurt yourself while showing off, and the injury is permanent.{}{}{}{}'No, you are not worthy yet. Perhaps someday. Farewell.'
5092:'Good. Let us begin.'{}{}{}{}The warrior stays with you for a time and puts you through rigorous training before moving on. 
5093:Thank him and wish him well.
5094:A wise one visits your village and offers his services as a trainer: {}{}{}{}'I can teach those who are willing, but I am not cheap. Or, if one of you is smart enough and shows me your mental aptitude, I may teach you a trick or two for free, as I am always looking for talent.'
5095:Pay to improve intelligence.
5096:Pay to improve wisdom.
5097:Pay to increase max mental health.
5098:[Intelligence]Show off your knowledge.
5099:'Yes, I see your talent. Let us begin.'{}{}{}{}The man stays with you for a time and puts you through rigorous training before moving on. 
5100:You strain yourself while showing off, and the injury is permanent.{}{}{}{}'No, you are not worthy yet. Perhaps someday. Farewell.'
5101:You come across a lone house and hear a lot of dwarvish swearing from the back. 
5102:You see a dwarf tearing his hair out and kicking a clay oven:{}{}{}{}'Ya bloody useless pile of junk. Get the fuck out me oven, ya son of a whore spirit!'
5103:[Dwarf]Tell your kin to calm down and tell you what is wrong.
5104:Ask the dwarf if he needs assistance.
5105:'Oh, you, stone and metal be kind to me! Can you talk some sense into the oven? I crafted it with my own hands, perfect -- keeps the temperature just so. I would bake the best cake there is!{}{}{}{}But no, this idiot spirit got itself trapped inside, and it won't leave!'
5106:A cake? That seems below his station.
5107:Does he know how to get rid of it?
5108:[Magic user]Tell him you can banish the spirit for him.
5109:[Goblin shaman or Spirits]You sense the ghost inside. Speak to it.
5110:'What, ya think a dwarven smith can only melt things, eh? Yer just like Helga. She said I won't be able to do it, and so I will do it!'{}{}{}{}He pulls a bit more of his already thinned hair out. 
5111:He looks distressed, so just nod. Does he know how to get rid of the ghost?
5112:'Who are you? I don't care! Can you talk some sense into the oven? I crafted it with my own hands, perfect - keeps the temperature just so. I would bake the best cake there is!{}{}{}{}But no, this idiot spirit got itself trapped inside, and it won't leave!'
5113:'Aye, that I do. This maggot got itself stuck in the bit of granite I used. I know just the lump it came from, but I am in the midst of making the best cake mix, I can't just leave.{}{}{}{}If ya go get the lump, I'll give ya a tip about a good place to mine. And a reward, too. Just hurry, please.'
5114:Go look for the granite lump.
5115:'Oh laddie, that makes me so happy! I'll pay ya nice for it.'
5116:Do the ritual.
5117:It may be too difficult. Does he know another way?
5118:You banish the spirit successfully and the dwarf claps his hands:{}{}{}{}'Aye, laddie, ya did it! Here, my reward for ya, but please do leave now, I need to focus!{}{}{}{}Oh, and I marked a resource vein for you on your map. Go get some good stone or metal.'{}{}
5119:You fail the ritual and it only angers the spirit. The clay oven shakes and turns blue. The dwarf is angry:{}{}{}{}'Ya best leave me be, lassie, I am in no mood for this!'
5120:You kill the dwarf, and the ghost calls out to you:{}{}{}{}'Oh, hey. Now that you have killed that rude oaf, could you free me, please?'
5121:What can be done?
5122:'There is a lump of granite that stupid dwarf broke down. If you bring it here, I can transfer back into it. I liked it there.'
5123:'You found it yet? No? Go away...'
5124:Leave to look for the obsidian lump to get rid of the ghost.
5125:You are badly beaten and chased away.
5126:'Ah, ya got it, great. Give it quick, I'll take it back myself. Here, a reward as promised! Metal and stone to ya, laddie. Oh, and I marked a spot for some good mining for ya too.'{}{}
5127:'Oh, you can speak to me, so you know about spirits, good. Please don't just banish me. If you take me out of here safely, I will come with you, eh?'
5128:Agree and tell the dwarf you will extract the ghost instead.
5129:'Fine with me, as long as ya don't damage my oven, right?'
5130:Say that there is no guarantee, but the chance for it is small.
5131:'What? No! Just banish the stupid thing!'
5132:Ignore him and extract the ghost.
5133:Banish the ghost.
5134:You extract the spirit successfully and the dwarf claps his hands:{}{}{}{}'Aye, laddie, ya did it! Here, my reward for ya, but please do leave now, I need to focus! Oh, and I marked a resource vein for you on your map. Go get some good stone or metal.'{}{}{}{}The ghost is now bound to you and also pleased.{}{}
5135:You extract the spirit successfully, but the ritual shatters the clay oven. The dwarf is not happy:{}{}{}{}'Oi, ya bloody lassies! All my efforts ruined! Ya best leave my sight before I thrash ya!'{}{}{}{}But at least the ghost is now bound to you and happy.{}{}
5136:Take the ghost and leave.
5137:You reach the small quarry where the dwarf said you need to find the granite lump, but the spot is buried in rubble. You need to dig it out.
5138:You find what you were looking for, along with some extra stone. Time to take it back to the dwarf.
5139:You find the blasted granite lump, but you get hurt by a sudden landslide. Better take this back to the dwarf now.
5140:You find what you were looking for and some extra stone. {}{}{}{}When you were walking back to the dwarf's place, the ghost appeared next to you:{}{}{}{}'This is close enough, just put it down on the floor here and leave me be, thanks! Here, I will try to give you some of my power to make you stronger.'{}{}
5141:Ask him if he'll come with you instead now that he's free from the oven.
5142:You fail to get the granite, and when you try to find the ghost in the dwarf's place, you find only a broken oven in an abandoned house.
5143:'Why not? I'll come.'
5144:You stumble across a couple of naked elves being violently assaulted by orcs. The orcs shout insults at them as they kick one lying on the floor:{}{}{}{}'You perverted scum best keep away from us, you hear?'
5145:Attack the orcs!
5146:Cheer for the orcs.
5147:Try to break this up by asking what is going on.
5148:None of your business, leave.
5149:The orcs pause and look your way:{}{}{}{}'Beat it. None of your business. Those two creeps were messing with our kid, so now they pay for it.'{}{}
5150:Cheer for the orcs. No one should mess with someone's children.
5151:Try to convince them that the elves look like they've paid already.
5152:You stand by as the elves are beaten to death. The orcs grunt in approval:{}{}{}{}'Good, you aren't one of those do-gooder types. We won't touch what this scum had on them, so you can have it if you like. And I tell you what, we have a youngster that needs to experience life, have them. May fire grow in your heart and ready you for battle!'{}{}{}{}They walk off, leaving you their child without so much as looking back. The child looks bewildered but defiant. 
5153:Take the kid. Collect what remains of the elves' belongings and leave.
5154:You stand by as the elves are beaten to death. The orcs grunt in approval:{}{}{}{}'Good, you aren't one of those do-gooder types. We won't touch what this scum had on them, so you can have it if you like. May fire grow in your heart and ready you for battle!'{}{}{}{}They walk off. 
5155:Collect what remains of the elves' belongings and leave.
5156:The orcs lower their weapons and fists and take a step back:{}{}{}{}'Bah, you do-gooder types. We found them two having sex here and they were going to come take our kid away next. We do not tolerate it! They must die for this.'{}{}{}{}The elves look barely alive and do not speak.
5157:[Orc]Beating down a couple of naked elves does look like fun, to be sure, but killing them? That seems without honour. 
5158:[Elf]It seems there must be more to this story. Implore the orcs to stop and allow your kin to speak. 
5159:Ask if they dislike it that the two lovers are men.
5160:Say that whatever the argument, surely, they beat them up enough already?
5161:'Too right! Men, doing it openly, like it is normal. It is not allowed, only females can wield the dark arts! And them wanting our boy, leading him on the same disgusting path. Perverts!'
5162:Agree with them, but say that the elves got their punishment, so perhaps it is enough.
5163:Tell the orcs they are backwards in their ways and should just stop now!
5164:[Wisdom or elf]Say that the elves are different. They wield high magic and their males as well as females can do it without the dark taint, not like humans or orcs. 
5165:'You talk a lot, and your words have calmed our fires. We leave the scum be, but they best stay away from us!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave and the elves try to pick themselves up.
5166:Help them out.
5167:Help them out but say you must leave now.
5168:One is barely conscious. The other speaks up, quietly:{}{}{}{}'Such pointless brutality...?they never even let us speak. I thank you, kind stranger. My soulmate would have perished before my very eyes were it not for you. All we did was offer to teach their boy the ways of magic. He seemed like a talented lad and destined for death amongst their kind. But we did not press the matter -- we were refused, so we left. And then this...'
5169:Ask if they will be all right now.
5170:'We were caught unaware in the midst of lovemaking. I have put my guard up now and will not allow this to happen again. The trees will guide us home. {}{}{}{}Here, a gift, and my eternal gratitude.'
5171:'You understand, good. Your words have calmed our fires. We leave the scum be, but they best stay away from us!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and the elves try to pick themselves up.
5172:'You do not understand, yet you wag your tongue at us. Still, your words have calmed our fires. We leave the scum be, but they best stay away from us!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and the elves try to pick themselves up.
5173:'We've heard this before. We do not believe it, but even if it is true, our child is not elven, so they should keep their pointy ears out of our business. Still, your words have calmed our fires. We leave the scum be, but they best stay away from us!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and the elves try to pick themselves up.
5174:'Too right there is more! I bet you are just as perverted as them, pointy ears. Men, doing it openly, like it is normal. It is not allowed, only females can wield the dark arts! And them wanting our boy, leading him on the same disgusting path. Perverts!'
5175:'Bah, damn you! Our fires burned too hot when those pointy ears wanted to take our child and teach it their own ways. But we should have stood in battle. I am shamed. Here, accept this as an honour price. We leave now. We must regain our pride. Be well, friend!'{}{}{}{}The orcs leave, and the elves try to pick themselves up.
5176:'You best move off, goody two shoes, or we'll beat you just as good!'
5177:You kill the orcs, and the elves try to pick themselves up and speak to you.
5178:The orcs beat you badly and force you to flee. You never learn what became of the elves.
5179:One of the two elven mages you once saved from orcs comes to you:{}{}{}{}'Welcome, friend. I trust you have been well? Amon'ath and I had the pleasure of welcoming offspring into our lives. The child is of an age now when they should learn the world. The orcs you saved us from were brutes, but we are equally stuck in our own ways. Perhaps with you, our child will grow to be more open. Please care for them.'
5180:Promise to care for the child.
5181:Politely decline and say that you would not split up a family like that.
5182:'Oh, how extraordinarily kind of you. Folk in these troubled times seem to grab any opportunity for the betterment of their lot, but you reject such clear advantage. Thank you - this is yet another lesson for us. {}{}{}{}Farewell, friend.'{}{}{}{}They depart.
5183:You see a giant spider sitting atop a child. It looks as if the child is struggling. 
5184:Run to kill the spider.
5185:You draw your weapons and prepare to fight, but the boy shouts from under the spider:{}{}{}{}'No, no! Don't kill my mum, we're only playing!'{}{}{}{}The spider turns to face you and stands protectively between you and the boy.
5186:Disgusting! Attack the spider!
5187:Ask if they are okay out here.
5188:Ask why he calls the spider mother.
5189:You kill the spider but the boy escapes, swearing revenge on you.
5190:'Yeah, we're okay, only, you see, my mum is ill and we're trying to retrieve a magical herb for her from that cave there. But there is some kind of force guarding it, and many brothers and sisters died already trying to get in.'
5191:Offer to see if you can get it.
5192:[Healer]Offer to take a look at the spider and see if you can cure her.
5193:'Because she is. She found me and raised me. It's a stupid question, really.'
5194:You try to enter the cave and indeed some force keeps you at bay.
5195:[Magic user]There is a protection spell here. Break it.
5196:Force your way in!
5197:You examine the spider and conclude that she suffers from an infection. It is also one that carries a spiritual taint, but once you heal the body, her spirit should heal in time.{}{}{}{}The spider bows before you and speaks for the first time, her voice crooked but clear:{}{}{}{}'You did me a service, humanoid. Some of my children will now serve you.'
5198:Thank her.
5199:She ushers the boy towards you:{}{}{}{}'Go, learn from your own kind. But you humanoids, beware: if my child dies, so will you!'
5200:You fail to help the spider and the boy, and they tell you to go away while they keep trying.
5201:You push through whatever barrier stood here and find some herbs inside. They do not look magical to you, but the spider seems very happy to get them.{}{}{}{}She bows before you and speaks for the first time, her voice crooked but clear:{}{}{}{}'You did me a service, humanoid. Some of my children will now serve you.'{}{}
5202:You break the spell and find some herbs inside. They do not look magical to you, but the spider seems very happy to get them.{}{}{}{}She bows before you and speaks for the first time, her voice crooked but clear:{}{}{}{}'You did me a service, humanoid. Some of my children will now serve you.'{}{}
5203:Your village is attacked by a horde of spiders, and you see a boy directing this attack.
5204:Plead with them to stop! Say that you are very sorry for killing his mother, but then again, isn't the law of nature that the strongest survive?
5205:You defeat the attackers and the vengeful child. A few young spiders swear service to you.
5206:Get back to work.
5207:You are defeated and stung with deadly poison as the boy laughs with satisfaction. The spiders also carry off your food supplies. 
5208:The boy halts the spiders:{}{}{}{}'Yes, it is true that mother failed at her duty. The nest does not get sad about such things. I behaved like a human again.'{}{}
5209:Offer him a place in your village.
5210:Tell him he seems to be doing well. Perhaps this was always his rite of passage. 
5211:'Yes, my time with the spiders is done.'
5212:Welcome the boy.
5213:'Yes, you are right. Your wisdom taught me much. Some of my siblings wish to stay with you. Bye.'
5214:Watch them go.
5215:'No, you killed her!'
5216:The spider boy you once promised to care for died on your watch, and his mother returns for revenge!
5217:[Beast]Tell the queen that it is the law of nature for the weak to die and the strong to survive. She is no human and should not behave like this!
5218:You kill the spiders and hope this is the end of it.
5219:You are badly bitten and poisoned, and the spiders carry off your food. But they do not kill you.
5220:'Yes, you are right. My attachment to the child was an oddity. I will leave you be.'{}{}{}{}She leaves and a few spiders remain with you, impressed with your dominance. 
5221:'Your words mean nothing. I warned you!'
5222:One of your children goes missing at night. You cannot find them anywhere!
5223:[Hunter or perception]Search for any tracks.
5224:The house demon has company and seems shifty. Question them.
5225:Give it time. The child will probably come back or they have been eaten already -- either way, nothing you can do.
5226:You track the child and see that it went to a small grove nearby.
5227:Mark it on the map.
5228:'Bah, I am not allowed to spill the beans, contracted demon and all, but...Ferdinand here, he isn't your house demon.'{}{}{}{}Ferdinand perks up:{}{}{}{}'Yes, yes, the kid went that way, towards that big tree. The children call it the safe place, sounds dodgy if you ask me.'
5229:Thank them and mark this place on your map.
5230:The child is gone and there's little to do but wait. 
5231:Your child returns to you changed. They tell you how they were spirited away by forest fairies who took all their teeth, but when they almost died from blood loss, a dola came and said this was the only way to save their life. 
5232:Your child returns to you changed. They tell you how they went to the safe place, where the water spirits sing songs and children can play with the pretty ladies from the lake. {}{}{}{}Only this time they swam in the lake, and they came back like this...?{}{}
5233:Your child returns to you ill and weak. They tell you how they went to the safe place, where the water spirits sing songs and children can play with the pretty ladies from the lake. {}{}{}{}Only this time they swam in the lake, and it was bad, so they ran away.{}{}
5234:Your child returns to you ill and weak. They tell you how they went to the safe place, where the forest spirits sing songs and children can play with the pretty ladies and the funny pine cones. {}{}{}{}They even brought a friend back.{}{}
5235:You find your child sleeping peacefully under a tree, by a small pond. {}{}{}{}You also spot a vodnik sitting on a stone in the water, watching the youth, pondering.
5236:[Water demon]Ask him what he's doing.
5237:Speak to the vodnik and ask why he is watching your child.
5238:Abandon your child and leave.
5239:'Oh, hello there, fellow waterling. I was merely mesmerised by the perfect peacefulness of this child's sleep. Alone, surrounded by so many friends, but not a care in the world...{}{}{}{}I was going to be whimsical and offer gifts if you solved a riddle for me, but you are kin, so I offer the gifts freely.'{}{}{}{}He claps his hands three times, then disappears in the pond.
5240:Thank him and accept the blessing for your child. Then take them home.
5241:Politely refuse and take your child home.
5242:'Oh, hello there. I was merely mesmerised by the perfect peacefulness of this child's sleep. Alone, surrounded by so many friends, but not a care in the world...{}{}{}{}I am feeling whimsical today, so I tell you what, you answer my riddle and I'll bestow a blessing on your child, eh?'
5243:Agree to answer the riddle.
5244:'You are clever, wonderful, well, here it goes.'{}{}{}{}He claps his hands three times, then disappears in the pond.
5245:'What a shame, and I cannot simply let it go either - demon lore, you see. Worry not, I will not do too much harm to the little one.'{}{}{}{}Before you can react, he claps his hands three times, then disappears in the pond.
5246:Take your child and go home.
5247:The vodnik is dead and you can take your child back home safely.
5248:You are badly beaten and your child is taken away!
5249:Crossing a woodland grove, you see a flickering of light and you sense the fluctuation of mystical power. 
5250:As you approach, you see the woodland shake as two spirits fight. One clearly emanates darkness, and the other shines as bright as the sun. {}{}{}{}The light spirit notices you and pleads:{}{}{}{}'Quick, aid me. This dark spirit seeks to corrupt this place, twist it to its own dark will. I am weakened. Please help, or at the very least, stay out of it!'
5251:[Turmoil or Magic]Through your domain, you feel the dark spirit reaching out. Listen.
5252:[Light or Harmony]Focus on this spirit of light. 
5253:[Nature or Intellect]Consider the scene carefully.
5254:[Elf]Examine the light.
5255:[Forest demon]Speak to this grove and examine it.
5256:You sense it is the spirit of darkness that is weak here. It seems to have no strength to speak to you, but you feel it reaching out for aid.{}{}
5257:Aid the spirit of darkness.
5258:Help the light.
5259:Do not interfere.
5260:The presence of light is overwhelming. The spirit burns bright within it, overshadowing the darkness almost entirely.
5261:This grove is indeed in peril. You see the tree bark scorched and the air thick with hot air. There is little life here, and that which you can sense seems oddly drone-like, lacking in the typical bustle of nature.
5262:The fading presence of darkness whispers:{}{}{}{}'Thank you. I felt this grove suddenly consumed by unnatural light, and as its opposite, I was drawn in by the forces of balance. But I was too weak. This power would have taken me and grown stronger.'
5263:Where did the light spirit come from?
5264:You weaken the spirit of light enough that the darkness is able to break it. The effort causes an explosion of dark energy and a lingering dark mist washes over the grove, twisting the plants and trees instantly. {}{}{}{}It also hits you and hurts you badly. There is only silence and darkness left now.
5265:Sensing your desire, the spirit of light speaks again:{}{}{}{}'Good. Now please, go to my friends nearby. They know a way to kill this spirit for good, else it will just come back. I will hold it as long as I can. Please hurry.'
5266:Go to the place marked by the spirit.
5267:The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Light eventually prevails, and as it consumes the darkness, it grows visibly stronger. Its tendrils now reach towards you and try to attack!
5268:Defend yourself. 
5269:The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Light eventually prevails, and as it consumes the darkness, it grows visibly stronger. Its tendrils now reach towards you and leave you with a blessing before shooting off into the distance.
5270:You fight off the light and are able to leave this grove.
5271:The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Darkness eventually consumes the light, although it looks weakened afterward. The dark power converges into a final gust of black mist that threatens to engulf you too.
5272:Leave quickly.
5273:You weaken the spirit of light enough that the darkness is able to break it. The effort causes an explosion of dark energy and a lingering dark mist washes over the grove, twisting the plants and trees instantly.{}{}{}{}You feel the darkness left you stronger.
5274:Ask the spirit what happened here.
5275:'It was always here. Every old grove has one. The elder children, elves are made of it. Whatever broke in our world when the earth shook, it made the light...wrong. And spirits of darkness like me, we are forever drawn to fight the light, only now it consumes us. I do not know how this is.'{}{}{}{}The spirit is almost gone now. You cannot hear it anymore.
5276:Your spirit is assaulted and your soul cursed before you manage to escape the clutches of this unnatural light.
5277:You find the cabal of darkness that the spirit of light sent you to destroy, and as you enter their circle, they turn to you with their unliving faces and attack!
5278:Speak to them instead. Tell them to stop the ritual supporting the spirit of darkness.
5279:You beat the wraiths and feel a release of power. Likely the ritual is broken. Strangely, you see the wraiths consumed by light from within before they disappear. {}{}
5280:Collect what is left here.
5281:[Magic user]Investigate further.
5282:You are badly beaten. The wraiths turn away from you and finish their ritual, then disappear.
5283:A hooded figure approaches:{}{}{}{}'Thank Svarog! You destroyed those dark fiends. I feel the spirit of darkness weaken, but now, we must perform a final rite to truly banish the taint. I need your help with it. Meet me back at the grove.'{}{}{}{}He rushes off. 
5284:Leave and go back to the spirit of light.
5285:As you collect what is left of the ritual, you see it was not strengthening anything. They were performing a warding ritual, trying to protect themselves. 
5286:Look around more.
5287:'Why do you serve them? The days of darkness are long gone, do you not see? Or are we all to be banished only for what we are, and they forever revered no matter what they actually do? {}{}{}{}Leave us be. We are not giving strength to the spirit you speak of, but simply trying to stay alive. We refuse to be taken by the light!'
5288:Ask them to tell you more of this.
5289:Say that you do not care. If they leave this place now, you will let them go.
5290:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, a heavy curse laid on your spirit. {}{}{}{}A great blast of power explodes from where the grove was, and when you see it next, it is a wasteland of burnt trees. 
5291:'Have you not felt the light's unnatural touch on the world, chosen ones? {}{}{}{}Yes, we serve darkness. Yes, our souls are long lost in the tumorous essence that sustains us. They pursue us fiercely, for once we are gone, the light will have a clear path.'
5292:Nod in agreement. Let them leave.
5293:Say that whatever the light may be doing, darkness remains a danger. Attack!
5294:'We shall depart. If the light believes you have slain us, we have some time. Do be careful with them, spawns of the gods. We do not like you, but you are needed.'{}{}{}{}They chant something together and dissolve into thin air.
5295:You get back to the grove and see the spirit of darkness diminished to a speck while the light pulsates hot and heavy. The priest of Svarog prepares a ritual and ushers you to come closer:{}{}{}{}'Come, let us finish this for good.'
5296:[Svarog]Take a closer look at this priest.
5297:Help in the ritual.
5298:The zerca carries the mark of Svarog, but it is darkened, broken. You do not sense in him the connection to you, to your god. He masks it well, as he is basked in the power of light. Not even those who follow the domain would see this truth, but you will not be fooled by an imposter.
5299:Challenge him and demand answers in the name of Svarog, now!
5300:'I am the true chosen of our god, the god of sun and light, not some homely craftsman that you say you serve, whelp!{}{}{}{}Light will cleanse this world and I serve it willingly until the time when I become one with it. For now I need to stay separate and aid the cause. Join us, and help me destroy this speck of darkness that stands defiant!
5301:[Marovit or Nyia]Focus on the darkness. 
5302:Convince him of your authority.
5303:You feel the dying dark is more than the essence of chaos. It is its pure speck, perhaps even a part of the old zmey, the one who sleeps under the cosmic tree, the one needed for balance to exist.
5304:Your ritual works and the spirit of darkness is consumed wholly by the light. You feel the earth tremble at this and see the grove awash with the scorching light. The woodland looks green and rejuvenated, and yet eerily still - not even the wind moves here.{}{}{}{}The spirit of light grows visibly stronger. Its tendrils now reach towards you and leave you with a blessing before shooting off into the distance.
5305:Wish it and the priest of Svarog well, and leave.
5306:Ask the priest if this is all now.
5307:See if the priest would like to join you.
5308:'My task here is done, so I do feel lost. Yes, I will join you and serve the gods as I should!'
5309:Your ritual fails or the spirit of darkness is simply too strong. Either way, a great spiritual explosion destroys the grove, kills the zerca, and throws you back. 
5310:'Yes, my task here is done and you aided the cause of light well, friends. I thank you once more.'
5311:Wish the priest of Svarog well, and leave.
5312:'I...I am so sorry. You are the chosen, you speak for the gods, and I should have listened. When I felt the power of this light, when it took my entire village and only I had the strength to deny it, I...it was easier to tell myself it was the gods and not my failure to protect my flock. Please, forgive me!'{}{}{}{}He takes out an object and throws it at the spirit of light. Whatever it was destroys both spirits instantly, leaving the grove free.
5313:Tell him you do forgive him, but he must stay on the right path from now on!
5314:Give him absolution and ask him to join you.
5315:Tell him it is not for you to forgive. He must find his own path to redemption.
5316:[Orc]Say that he needs to die with honour now. It is the only way!
5317:He looks surprised, and under normal circumstances, he would likely question the words of an orc, but he bows to your will:{}{}{}{}'I swear on the sun itself I will seek this redemption!'{}{}{}{}He departs but leaves you his things.
5318:'Yes, of course. I will follow you now and stay on the right path. Thank you!'
5319:'I swear to you I will find a way to make it right!'{}{}{}{}He departs but leaves you his things.
5320:'I serve the true light. Join us or leave, but do not interfere in what is inevitable!'
5321:When the zerca dies, it weakens the spirit of light enough that the darkness is able to break it. The effort causes an explosion of dark energy and a lingering dark mist washes over the grove, twisting the plants and trees instantly.{}{}{}{}You feel the darkness left you stronger.
5322:The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Light eventually prevails and the priest is incinerated in its blast. As it consumes the fallen spirit of darkness, it grows visibly stronger and tries to infect you.{}{}{}{}You escape, but not without harm.
5323:The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Darkness eventually overpowers the light, and the zerca runs away. The dark power converges into a final gust of black mist that threatens to engulf you too.
5324:You fail to stop the zerca, and he tries to aid the light without you. The two spirits remain locked in battle. The grove is slowly consumed by this conflict as some trees lie scorched and others are twisted into dark husks. {}{}{}{}Light eventually prevails, and the priest is incinerated in its blast. As it consumes the fallen spirit of darkness, it grows visibly stronger and tries to infect you.{}{}{}{}You escape, but not without harm.
5325:One of your people has been acting oddly over the last few days. They seem weak, they sweat more, and sometimes you catch them speaking to themselves. 
5326:They must be ill. Try to cure them.
5327:[Healer]Examine them.
5328:[Zerca or wisdom]Observe them further to try to determine what is wrong.
5329:They seem suspicious. Give them a good beating, just in case it is a demon hiding in plain sight.
5330:You try your best to cure your friend and think you did it. They start acting normal again, and even feel stronger for it.
5331:You try your best to cure your friend and think you did it, but it turns out they were not ill - or at least, that was not their problem. A manoviec, a demon who mimics people, has taken their place. {}{}{}{}After the demon has their fun, they leave your village, and your real friend is returned, but diminished.
5332:Whatever illness this is, it beats you and your friend falls gravely ill. Even if they survive, they will have scars.
5333:They do seem to suffer from an odd ailment. You know how to try to help them, but you suspect the illness may be the symptom of a much darker secret - this person may be a manoviec, a demon who can mimic folk.{}{}{}{}You must act fast, for if they are truly ill, they may die without help.
5334:Try to heal them anyway, whoever they are now.
5335:Beat the truth out of this fiend with wicker and fire!
5336:[Zerca or wisdom]Demons obey demon lore. Try to trick it to admit who they really are.
5337:'No, no, please stop, fine, I am a changeling. I will go and let your friend free, just leave me be!'{}{}{}{}The body of the creature begins to dissolve into a purple blob, and from the blob your own friend is spat out. 
5338:Take your friend, then kill the blob with fire!
5339:Allow it to leave.
5340:Either the creature will not break, or your friend was just very ill. Either way, they are now near death.
5341:Eventually the illness passes, leaving your friend's body devastated. But it turns out they were not simply ill - or at least that was not their true problem. A manoviec, a demon who mimics people, kidnapped your friend and took their place. {}{}{}{}After the demon has their fun, they leave your village, and your friend is returned, but diminished.
5342:Eventually the illness passes, leaving your friend's body devastated.
5343:They do seem to suffer from an odd ailment. You know how to try to help them, but you suspect the illness may be the symptom of a much darker secret -- this person may be a manoviec, a demon who can mimic folk.{}{}{}{}You must act fast, for if they are truly ill, they may die without help.
5344:[Healer]Try to heal them anyway, whoever they are now.
5345:'Ah, damn it, you got me! And since I owe you now, I suppose you'll want your friend back. Just let me leave, all right?'{}{}{}{}The body of the creature begins to dissolve into a purple blob, and from the blob your own friend is spat out. 
5346:You kill the blob with fire, but the purple smoke proves toxic. 
5347:You beat your kinsman well and good, but they insist they are no demon. They finally collapse from the wounds and the fever. {}{}{}{}It seems they were just ill.
5348:You question and trick the patient many times over. They are very confused and fall more feverish with each passing hour.{}{}{}{}It seems they were just ill.
5349:You kill the creature. Alas, this does not bring your friend back.
5350:You kill your friend, and, well, either the demon hides its form very cleverly, or it was not a demon...
5351:The body of the creature begins to dissolve into a purple blob, and from the blob your own friend is spat out. 
5352:A tailor travelling with bodyguards visits your village:{}{}{}{}'I am the best tailor you will find on this rickety island. I deal only with light goods - none of that ugly, heavy sort. Please take a look.'
5353:[Orc]One of the bodyguards spat on the ground when they saw you and now they are staring at you. Challenge them!
5354:Steal the clothes when they go to rest at night!
5355:Offer your hospitality, but nothing more.
5356:'Don't speak to me, orc scum. I am here working, so I will stay still, but I will not talk to those who murdered my village!'
5357:Congratulate her on being the strongest of her clan. Only the strong survive!
5358:Tell her to stop being a coward, and come out and face you!
5359:Say that she is a fool for making such broad assumptions. Would she spit in the face of the goddess Zorya too?
5360:The woman and her friends bow to you in apology:{}{}{}{}'I am sorry. My anger got the better of me. It happened not long ago, and no one will go with me to take vengeance!'
5361:Offer to go with her, if she likes.
5362:Tell her that vengeance is a bad goal. Best to focus on rebuilding.
5363:'Yes, thank you. And here, for my rudeness earlier. May the gods forgive my foolishness.'{}{}{}{}She steps back to continue her guard duty.
5364:You steal the robes with no trouble, but you wake to find yourself cursed. The gods do not take breaking the hospitality rules lightly. 
5365:You steal the robes with no trouble, but the word has spread that you broke the guest rules.
5366:You are beaten, and the word has spread that you broke the guest rules.
5367:'Yes! I am the huntress, Talia, by the way. I will mark their location and join you there. Thank you.'{}{}{}{}She speaks to the others and leaves quickly.
5368:Mark the location on your map and get back to work.
5369:'Leave us be, orc.'
5370:Walk away.
5371:You kill them and take the robes with no trouble, but you wake to find yourself cursed. The gods do not take breaking the hospitality rules lightly. 
5372:You kill them and take the robes with no trouble, but the word has spread that you broke the guest rules.
5373:You track down the orcs that the huntress Talia asked you to find. She joins you:{}{}{}{}'There you are! I've been waiting here for a while. Come, let us sneak up on them and kill them like they did my people!'
5374:Warn the orcs and give them Talia.
5375:Watch her run and kill herself, then leave.
5376:You slaughter the orcs and Talia is overjoyed:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, thank you so much! Here, this is all I can pay with.'{}{}{}{}She gives you the reward and gathers her things to leave.
5377:Ask her to stay with you.
5378:Tell her that you were glad to help, and leave.
5379:Talia is caught and brutally killed by the orcs. They turn to you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, we've been trying to hunt this one down for weeks. Their hunters killed our alpha while she was birthing her heir! They all had to die for it, and thanks to you, our fortune will return now. Here, a reward. Be well!'
5380:'Oh, and here, this whelp is too weak for us. We were going to leave them to the wolves, but I heard you like such weaklings, so take it, leave it, whatever.'{}{}{}{}They present you an orc child.
5381:Take them.
5382:Leave them.
5383:'Yes, yes I will!'
5384:You lose, but thankfully the orcs only kill Talia and leave you be.
5385:You come across a battle scene. Many dwarves lie dead at the feet of one warrior, hooded and clad in heavy armour. {}{}{}{}As you arrive, he plunges his weapon into the chest of yet another victim:{}{}'I will track down every last one of you.' His voice is guttural and echoes strangely. He turns to you, but does not approach.
5386:[Dwarf]Avenge your brethren. Attack!
5387:Ask him why the massacre.
5388:Leave him be.
5389:'None of your business. Begone.'
5390:Attack him.
5391:[Runemaster]Observe him further, as he seems familiar.
5392:You destroy the warrior and find that he had no body, only an empty metal shell.
5393:Gather what is usable and leave.
5394:He is no man, but a warrakus, a golem-like creature brought to life by ingenious runemasters of old. {}{}{}{}Strange, though, that this one killed dwarves, and stranger yet that he speaks with such independence in your presence.
5395:Demand that he explain himself, now!
5396:Ask him why he killed all those dwarves. Does his master command him to do so?
5397:'Demand? You and your kind will never demand anything from me! You thought you can take my soul and craft it as your slave. But I am Warrax, a warlord. I will not be bound so. Die!'
5398:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. Luckily the warrior does not pursue.
5399:'It is none of your business, dwarf, nor do I have a master.' He spits on the body he just killed.{}{}{}{}'Leave, before you join your kind.'
5400:You come across the same hooded, armour-clad warrior you once saw massacre a group of dwarves. He is now standing over the bodies of many goblins. A shaman remains, protected by a barrier, but the warrior bashes against it relentlessly, and you know it will eventually break.
5401:[Goblin]Rescue the shaman. Attack!
5402:Ask him to stop this bloodshed. Perhaps there is something you can do to end it.
5403:'I am held hostage to their dark magic. To be truly free, I must destroy all who enslaved me. I will be free and others will not fall to their dirty work. Collateral damage is to be expected.'{}{}
5404:[Runemaster or Shaman]Does he speak to the ancient legends of the warrakus? 
5405:Ask him what he means by all this.
5406:Say that whatever revenge he seeks, surely it is done now. Or perhaps there is a better way to serve it, without the collateral damage.
5407:Agree with him and allow him to kill the shaman.
5408:'You are like those who did this. But you are not them, so you do not have to die.{}{}{}{}Yes, I am Warrax, once a warlord of Slavya, loyal follower of the mighty Perun. My soul was resting when it was pulled by this shaman's forefather and enslaved by the runemasters. They made me into a warrakus, a mockery of my name! I was first and I will be last!'
5409:[Magic or Nature]To pull a soul from its rightful afterlife for such a purpose violates the laws! Yes, he and all who were involved must die. Pledge your assistance to Warrax.
5410:'Fine. If you swear to aid me, I will strip this shaman and the runemaster that yet lives of any knowledge and power they hold about this. They will be damaged, but alive. This is my final offer.'
5411:Agree to help him.
5412:Say that you changed your mind. Allow him to kill the shaman and whomever else he wishes.
5413:Tell him you cannot help, but neither will you interfere. Leave.
5414:'I will do most of this ritual myself. I will lend you my friend and he will aid you in doing your part.'{}{}{}{}He draws a pentagram around the shaman, who looks at all of you, terrified but defiant. Warrax takes out a book bound in what looks like human skin and begins reading from it.
5415:The ritual works and the shaman falls to his knees, crying. His barrier collapses and some tattoos on his body fade away, leaving only bloody marks. His eyes glaze over as he looks at you, bewildered:{}{}{}{}'You took them away. I cannot hear them, they are gone! Do you know what you've done? Hundreds of years of knowledge passed down in my bloodline, gone...' He cries. 
5416:Turn to Warrax.
5417:Tell him it is his own fault for misusing spirits. 
5418:'It is good that one such as you sees the truth of my actions.'{}{}{}{}Warrax swings his weapon a few more times and the barrier collapses, as does the shaman's severed head. The warrior turns to you:{}{}{}{}'I have but one more to kill. I suppose if you were to aid me, we would not have to kill everyone, but I need to be more careful and swift when I work alone.'
5419:Wish him luck, but say that you do not wish to take part in more killing.
5420:'Yes, Perun is gone, but I am glad his children guide you well.'{}{}{}{}Warrax swings his weapon a few more times and the barrier collapses, as does the shaman's severed head. The warrior turns to you:{}{}{}{}'I have but one more to kill. I suppose if you were to aid me, we would not have to kill everyone, but I need to be more careful and swift when I work alone.'
5421:'I see. It is your choice. I am glad you decided not to stand in my way.'{}{}{}{}Warrax swings his weapon a few more times and the barrier collapses, as does the shaman's severed head. The warrior turns to you:{}{}{}{}'I leave now to finish this. I assume you do not wish to be involved. Farewell.'
5422:'I am Warrax, once a warlord of Slavya, loyal follower of the mighty Perun. My soul was resting when it was pulled by this shaman's forefather and enslaved by the runemasters. They made me into a warrakus, a mockery of my name! I was first and I will be last!'
5423:'I leave now. I have but one more to punish: a grand runemaster. Come aid me if you wish him to remain alive.'{}{}{}{}He departs.
5424:Mark the location on your map and leave.
5425:The goblin does not reply. It looks like he is trying to cast a curse on you, but clearly, he has no power. 
5426:The ritual works but it was costly for you. The shaman falls to his knees, crying. His barrier collapses and some tattoos on his body fade away, leaving only bloody marks. His eyes glaze over as he looks at you, bewildered:{}{}{}{}'You took them away. I cannot hear them, they are gone! Do you know what you've done? Hundreds of years of knowledge passed down in my bloodline, gone...' He cries. 
5427:'Do not meddle in my affairs. I wish you no harm, but I will kill all that stand in my way!'
5428:You find the forge where a grand runemaster of old lives, the one responsible for creating Warrax.{}{}{}{}The warrior joins you. He looks battered and worn out:{}{}{}{}'You are here, good. I have disabled the dwarves. I tried not to kill too many, for you. The runemaster is bound and now we must once more perform the binding ritual, but my friend cannot aid you this time, as he perished in this fight. This peace of yours is costly.'
5429:Perform the ritual.
5430:Return later.
5431:You perform the ritual outside the forge, and when it is done, you hear screams from inside, followed by some impressive dwarven swearing. Warrax comes out, dragging a dwarf dressed in robes:{}{}{}{}'He is the last. He has paid. You aided me and so I swear I will not pursue further revenge, unless the fiends find a way to regain their knowledge. Agreed?'
5432:Agree to his terms. Tell him you are thankful he chose a less bloody path.
5433:Nod in agreement. Ask the dwarf if he is okay.
5434:'Who are ya? What is going on here? I...?I was working, but what was I working on? Who am I?'{}{}{}{}Warrax throws the dwarf aside.{}{}{}{}'He lives. And once his brothers wake, they will care for him. Do not pity the monster, friend. Now I must find a path to follow.'{}{}{}{}He prepares to leave.
5435:Ask him to stay with you.
5436:Wish him good luck.
5437:'Yes, I will remain with you. Now that my maker is gone, I am weakened, but I am sure I can make my metal useful again.'
5438:Warrax throws the dwarf aside.{}{}{}{}'Good. Perhaps your way was better, for now they will suffer, always feeling empty and lost, like I did for so long. Now I must find a path to follow.'{}{}{}{}He prepares to leave.
5439:The ritual fails and the dwarven runemaster kills Warrax, then says:{}{}{}{}'Bah, I should have killed ya decades ago, old friend, you were all wrong. I am sorry.'{}{}{}{}He turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Ya best leave, lassies, I have no patience for ya.'
5440:You find the forge where a grand runemaster of old lives, the one responsible for creating Warrax. {}{}{}{}The warrior joins you. He looks battered and worn out:{}{}{}{}'You are here, good. You will attack them first, and they will feel confident in their victory after seeing your inferior power. I will then surprise them from the flank. Ready?'
5441:You defeat the dwarves and you see Warrax coming towards you, dragging the headless body of a dwarf dressed in robes:{}{}{}{}'He is the last. He has paid. You aided me, so I leave the fate of the others in your hands. Agreed?'
5442:Agree and kill off the remainder of the dwarves.
5443:Nod in agreement and say that the others are to be left alive.
5444:'Fine. They live. Only those involved had to pay. Now I must find a path to follow.'{}{}{}{}He prepares to leave.
5445:Warrax throws the dwarf aside.{}{}{}{}'Good. You understand revenge. My friend wishes to remain with you, so take care of him. Now I must find a path to follow.'{}{}{}{}He prepares to leave.
5446:The dwarves prove stronger, and the dwarven runemaster kills Warrax, then says:{}{}{}{}'Bah, I should have killed ya decades ago, old friend, you were all wrong. I am sorry.'{}{}{}{}He turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Ya best leave, lassies, I have no patience for ya.'
5447:Travelling through the volcanic lands, you spot a small orc settlement, hidden within a lava cave, as is their custom.{}{}{}{}You hear the unmistakable clash of swords and smell the metallic odour of spilled blood. You also spot arrows flying - elven arrows.
5448:[Orc]Charge in to aid this orc clan against the filthy elves!
5449:[Elf]There must be a good reason for this violence. Aid your own kin and attack the orcs.
5450:[Goblin]Orcs are getting whupped? Good. Help the attackers!
5451:Sneak in to see if you can pilfer any goods while both sides are busy.
5452:Wait it out, then go inspect what is left.
5453:Attack the elves.
5454:Attack the orcs.
5455:Leave it all.
5456:You kill the elves and the orc matriarch approaches:{}{}{}{}'This was a good battle! Those cowards chose a time when our hunting parties are out, only men and children left, plus a handful of true warriors. We would have died in honour, of course, but to win alongside good warriors is much better!'
5457:Ask why they attacked. It is not typical to find many elves on this land.
5458:Tell her the honour is all hers. It was a good battle indeed.
5459:'Why should I care? Why do elves ever do anything? Sexless, arrogant flowers that they are, they were probably wrong in the head from all the dirty magic their men do. {}{}{}{}No matter, my honour to you, friend.'
5460:'Fire burns bright in our hearts, that's for sure! Here, a gift from me.{}{}{}{}Now, those buggers destroyed my home, so we will pack up and leave, but you can have some credit in our stores and trade with us before we go.'
5461:[Male]You see the matriarch looking at you lustfully. Return the look.
5462:[Female]The matriarch is looking at you strangely. Ask her why.
5463:'Now time for us to go. May the fire never die down, friend!'
5464:'The rest of you can eat, drink, and rest. The two of us, we have some fires to quench!'{}{}{}{}She grabs you forcefully and drags you to her bed, which is surprisingly fire-free. {}{}{}{}Later, she delivers a child to you with a note:{}{}{}{}'This whelp is mixed. It will be better off with its father.'
5465:'The rest of you can eat, drink, and rest. The two of us, we have some fires to quench!'{}{}{}{}She grabs you forcefully and drags you to her bed, which is surprisingly fire-free. 
5466:Hard Club grabs you forcefully and drags you to his bunk, which is filled with hot coals, of course. {}{}{}{}Sometime later, a child comes out of this fiery union.
5467:'You look like you need a good old thumping from one of my males. Hard Club over there looks like he's into you.'{}{}{}{}Indeed, a bloodied warrior holding his thick club in both hands is watching you.
5468:Why not? Have some fun.
5469:Politely decline and trade instead.
5470:Hard Club grabs you forcefully and drags you to his bunk, which is filled with hot coals, of course. 
5471:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. If you return later, you find the settlement burnt to the ground.
5472:You kill the orcs and an elven archer approaches:{}{}{}{}'Thank you for your aid, it was unexpected but most welcome. These animals bite hard, even when disadvantaged as they were here.'
5473:'It is not information we can share with outsiders. Suffice to say they committed grave crimes against our kin and have now suffered the inevitable consequences. {}{}{}{}Killing the young is of course regrettable, yet sometimes one needs to cull the whole herd to be rid of illness.'
5474:What? They killed children here?
5475:'An odd outburst for one that gave aid in attacking a settlement. Orc children do not hide in battle - they take arms. As such, they sadly fall in such conflicts. {}{}{}{}We must depart these horrendously ugly lands. Fare thee well, friends, and please accept our gifts to you. You may also choose something from our stocks.'
5476:'We must depart these horrendously ugly lands. Fare thee well, friends, and please accept our gifts to you. You may also choose something from our stocks.'
5477:The orcs beat you badly and leave you bleeding, but you did make the job easier for the elves, who slaughter their enemy.{}{}{}{}The elves merely check whether you are alive before leaving you without a word of thanks.
5478:You sneak in and steal what you can while the battle rages on. 
5479:You are spotted and barely escape with your life.
5480:Even in hiding, you are hit by stray arrows, or maybe they are warning shots. The elves kill, burn, and plunder the settlement before they finally leave. {}{}{}{}You do not find anything of use.
5481:Even in hiding, you are hit by stray arrows, or maybe they are warning shots. The elves kill, burn, and plunder the settlement before they finally leave. {}{}{}{}But orcs build with fire in mind, so you are able to salvage some goods.
5482:Even in hiding, you are hit by stray arrows, or maybe they are warning shots. The elves kill, burn, and plunder the settlement before they finally leave. {}{}{}{}But orcs build with fire in mind, so you are able to salvage some goods and rescue a wounded child.
5483:After the elves leave, you find and rescue a wounded orc child. You find it locked in a chest and knocked unconscious - perhaps the parent did not want them to fight in a lost battle. At least the child will not know you were the one who killed their family.
5484:Take the child and leave.
5485:You notice that some of your resources are gone!
5486:Try to track the thieves.
5487:You could swear you followed their tracks, only to find they led you right back to the village.
5488:[Hunter or perception]Take a closer look.
5489:[Intelligence]Try to figure this out.
5490:You could swear you followed their tracks, but they suddenly disappeared when you got to a cliff, even though they looked like human tracks.
5491:You could swear you followed their tracks, but they suddenly disappeared under a tree, and there is no sign of someone climbing up.
5492:You try your best to track the thieves, but it is as if the resources just disappeared, without any trace.
5493:The thieves must have worn their shoes and horseshoes backwards to confuse anyone following their tracks. {}{}{}{}But now you have the right trail to follow.
5494:You have no idea what happened here and no way to track them further.
5495:The thieves must have been in league with the vily, as you found their tracks near the cliff. The demons must have carried them away. {}{}{}{}But now you have the right trail to follow.
5496:The thieves must have been in league with goblins, as eventually you discover odd contraptions that hide the ropes they used to climb the trees quickly and evade capture.{}{}{}{}But now you have the right trail to follow.
5497:The thieves were clever indeed. They dug a tunnel underneath your storehouse and covered it up when they escaped.{}{}{}{}But now you have the right trail to follow.
5498:You find the lair of the thieves who stole your goods.
5499:Attack head on!
5500:Set a trap.
5501:[Attractive]Parley with them. Convince them that all this is not worth the trouble, and you can be friends instead.
5502:The bandits lie dead and you can reclaim your goods.
5503:You are badly beaten, forced to flee and abandon more of your goods.
5504:While you talk, they sneak up on you. You are badly beaten, forced to flee and abandon more of your goods.
5505:'Aye, you do talk well and look good. Must be that Lada goddess rubbing off on our sorry arses. Here, have your shit back and let us drink together!'
5506:Drink, then take your goods and leave.
5507:You are approached by an odd company of three. The first, an elf, introduces themselves as Anjel. The second is a fat goblin with a grey beard and red coat who tells you he is Mikulas. The last one is clearly a czort, riding his white goat.{}{}{}{}They bow and ask to join your campsite.
5508:'Ah, children!' exclaims Mikulas, who produces some beetle jelly for the youngsters. He then turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Each one of us can offer you a duel of sorts - a splendid game, to be sure.'{}{}{}{}The goblin is eerily cheerful, while the elf remains aloof and the czort, well, it stares at you with a mischievous smile.
5509:Test your storytelling skills against Mikulas as he sits by the fire and tells you of faraway frozen lands and his wife.
5510:Stand against Anjel and their mystical skill.
5511:Arm-wrestle the czort.
5512:Politely decline and offer your food instead. 
5513:'Ahaha, your tales are woven with charm and intrigue. I love it! As I am the spirit of my forefathers, I shall gift you with their wisdom and perhaps more. Cheerio!'{}{}{}{}All three strangers nod and depart together.
5514:Mikulas's stories are so enthralling, you get lost in his fantastic worlds. You feel so dazed that you do not even notice when the guests leave. {}{}{}{}There is a note from the storyteller:{}{}'Best of luck next time. Have some beetle jelly to cheer you up.'
5515:'Your skill is tolerable.'{}{}{}{}All three strangers nod and depart together.
5516:Anjel's cold gaze unnerves you, and you fail to impress them with your skills.{}{}{}{}The three depart without any further words.
5517:'What, you won? How dare you!' The czort huffs and puffs at you, but calms down quickly. You feel stronger from this.{}{}{}{}All three strangers nod and depart together.
5518:You'd swear that czorts shouldn't be this strong; trickery is likely. Nevertheless, the creature huffs and puffs at you with joy:{}{}{}{}'Hah, got ya!'{}{}{}{}The three depart without any further words.
5519:'Welcome!' exclaims Mikulas:{}{}{}{}'Each one of us can offer you a duel of sorts - a splendid game, to be sure.'{}{}{}{}The goblin is eerily cheerful, while the elf remains aloof and the czort, well, it stares at you with a mischievous smile.
5520:'Yes, it is right to accept such hospitality.'{}{}{}{}Anjel looks disinterested and the czort does not look pleased, but all three depart after eating.
5521:You find two bodies of human gatherers, stretched on racks. Looks like one almost got free. They are holding a torn note in their hand. The only bit you can make out is:{}{}{}{}'...speak orcish inquisition.'
5522:Say 'orcish inquisition.'
5523:Give the dead a burial, gather what you can, and leave.
5524:As soon as you speak the words, several odd-looking orcs appear. They are wearing surprisingly formal red coats, and some also wear goggles and hold books. One of the angry-looking lot speaks:{}{}{}{}'You speak - spoke? - our name, so we are here to punish you! You never expected us, eh?'
5525:[Orc]Demand to know what sort of dishonourable foolery is this.
5526:[Zerca]Are they pretending to be the old western organisation of the so-called inquisition? If so, why?
5527:They look at each other as if searching for an answer, then two of them take out their weapons:{}{}{}{}'Here is our one true weapon: surprise and fear. Bow before it!'
5528:Tell them they called out two weapons, which really diminished the whole intimidation angle...
5529:Attack the fools!
5530:'What , you...we meant our two greatest weapons: fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency. So bow down, fools!'
5531:And now they called out three. Tell them this is really becoming embarrassing.
5532:'Oh, ehm, three, ehm...?oh, bugger it all!'{}{}{}{}The orcs break down in lamentation and run off.
5533:Bury the dead humans and leave.
5534:While you were mocking the orcs, they managed to completely surround you, so you have to submit and one of you is stretched on a rack - one that oddly still holds some dried food.{}{}{}{}The orcs must have run out of racks...they are not well prepared for this. They just leave after a few hours.
5535:Take your friend down from the rack and leave.
5536:You kill the odd orcs. They were poorly equipped and much of what they carried was makeshift. You do find a rack of dried food.
5537:You lose and the orcs manage to completely surround you, so you have to submit and one of you is stretched on a rack - one that oddly still holds some dried food.{}{}{}{}The orcs must have run out of racks. They just leave after a few hours.
5538:'We do this job now, we no need to listen to you anymore! Yeah, so you submit to our one great weapon surprise and fear, bow before it!'
5539:Tell the dumb-arses that is two weapons, and you will stick those weapons up their butts so far, they will truly be surprised and fearful!
5540:'Oh, shits, I am so sorry...we never meant to, it was just jokes - funny stuff. Ehm, please don't flail us or tell on us to mother.'{}{}{}{}The orcs break down in lamentation and run off.
5541:'A what? Eh? We found this book, it was about pythons or something, and it spoke to us and -'{}{}{}{}Another orc kicks him and shouts:{}{}{}{}'Here is our one true weapon: surprise and fear. Bow before it!'{}{}
5542:Tell them the goddess Zorya, or Zorza as they know her, does not like pranks and jokes from her warriors!
5543:'Oh, ehm, yeah, damn it guys, they are so right! We'll be in so much trouble now!' {}{}{}{}The orcs break down in lamentation and run off.
5544:You hear a beautiful pipe melody at night and it lulls you to sleep. When you wake, you realise one of your children is gone!
5545:[Forest folk]Speak to the forest. Ask it to aid you in finding the child.
5546:[Hunter]Track the child.
5547:[Zerca]The melody sounded familiar to you. Try to figure out the lore.
5548:Search for your child.
5549:The forest answers and guides you. You find the child tied to a tree by blood vines pulsating in the rhythm of the pipe song. {}{}{}{}A rhoggnyr is attached to a similar contraption, only he is the recipient of the child's blood. {}{}{}{}You got here quickly. The creature is distracted and your child still living.
5550:Kill the beast and rescue the child!
5551:Take the child, but question the beast in the name of nature, for you have never seen a rhoggnyr act like this.
5552:The rhoggnyr cries out as your blade cuts cleanly through his guts. {}{}{}{}When you search the place, you find other victims, though sadly it is unlikely any are still alive.
5553:Search for survivors, bury the dead, and leave.
5554:You find the child tied to a tree by blood vines pulsating in the rhythm of the pipe song. {}{}{}{}A rhoggnyr is attached to a similar contraption, only he is the recipient of the child's blood. {}{}{}{}Your child looks barely alive, and the perpetrator wakes in time to stand against you!
5555:He is too strong. Leave the child.
5556:You find the child tied to a tree by blood vines pulsating in the rhythm of the pipe song. The youth is dead and whatever took them is not here.
5557:The creature squirms under the pressure of your blade, but he tries to remain defiant:{}{}{}{}'I am the forest king! I do what my nature compels me to do. I acquired the pipes and they whispered to me of a way to gain more life. I am not sorry!'
5558:Kill him and search this place.
5559:Let him go. It is a demon's nature to feed on the young. Search this place.
5560:You find the child tied to a tree by blood vines pulsating in the rhythm of the pipe song. {}{}{}{}A rhoggnyr is attached to a similar contraption, only he is the recipient of the child's blood. {}{}{}{}You got here quickly. The creature is distracted and your child still living.
5561:You recall old tales of demons who play enchanted pipes to lure children into their lair. This melody leaves an odd stench, so you follow it. You find the child tied to a tree by blood vines pulsating in the rhythm of the pipe song. {}{}{}{}A rhoggnyr is attached to a similar contraption, only he is the recipient of the child's blood. {}{}{}{}You got here quickly. The creature is distracted and your child still living.
5562:You kill the creature and rescue the child, who is in desperately poor condition. {}{}{}{}When you search the place, you find other victims, though sadly it is unlikely any are still alive.
5563:The creature defeats you and forces you to flee and abandon your child.
5564:The skies darken, and at first you think the black mist is descending. Gradually, you realise that a shadow being is carefully examining each of you and nodding to itself, as if taking notes.{}{}{}{}It whispers: 'Have you talents that shall marvel me?'{}{}
5565:Ask what it wants.
5566:Try to chase it away.
5567:Attempt to leave.
5568:The demonic apparition is unmoved by any of your actions, and you find yourself unable to move.{}{}{}{}'Amuse me.'{}{}{}{}Runic symbols burn into your skin, each one slightly different. Some of you will now be compelled to perform trials, and you have a feeling they are not optional.
5569:[Magic user]One challenger is called to show their spiritual power. Submit to the test.
5570:[Strength]One challenger is called to show their brute force. Submit to the test.
5571:[Intelligence]One challenger is called to show their intellect. Submit to the test.
5572:The being finds you all lacking, so it throws a random four of you into a dark pit of black mist crawling with toxic insects. Try to climb out!
5573:'I suppose you aren't entirely useless. One of you may do as an oddity, yes.' {}{}{}{}His shadowy face turns away as if speaking into the mist: 'Well, you're a pointless waste of space.' {}{}{}{}Someone or something is thrown out of the mist, but before you can have a look at it, the demon reaches to grab one of you!
5574:You defeat the demon, and it cries out as it is pulled back into the darkness:{}{}'How splendid, I who collect will one day return for such specimens...?'{}{}{}{}He is gone, and you are left with his rejected collectible.
5575:Take them and leave.
5576:'Useless. Yes, I knew it. Suffer for wasting my time!'{}{}{}{}The apparition dissolves into a shadow, leaving you weakened.
5577:'Cowardly and useless. Yes, I knew it. Suffer for wasting my time!'{}{}{}{}The apparition dissolves into a shadow, leaving you cursed and weakened.
5578:You are defeated and can only watch as he reaches for one of you!
5579:Lie low but watch where he goes. Perhaps you can track him later.
5580:You find the fiend that took your folk, and he has company now. 
5581:[Magic user]Face them with spirit!
5582:The demon and his minions lie defeated, and now you can rescue your friend.
5583:You are defeated. The demon disappears and so does your friend.
5584:As you travel through the forest and walk through a glade past a swampy terrain, you hear a rustling of leaves.{}{}{}{}You soon spot a wounded goblin lying under a tree, with several animals with him, while a bog bies seems to circle them from the shadows, but does not approach.
5585:Nope! Just leave.
5586:As you carefully come closer, you see the animals are an odd menagerie, likely a group of forest sprites. One looks like an overgrown ginger cat, one is a rabbit with horns, a stone sloth hangs from a tree branch, and the tree itself has many eyes yet clearly is not a leshy.
5587:This is all very suspicious. When in doubt, charge!
5588:[Healer]Offer to try to heal the goblin.
5589:The bog bies may attack at any time. Kill that first.
5590:[Magic user]Bog bies, like their older brothers, are creatures tormented by possession. Try to free this one, and perhaps it will serve you.
5591:You defeat the forest sprites and the goblin who tried and failed to help his friends. As one of them turns back into the ginger cat, it whispers:{}{}{}{}'We had a good run, Zosh. Till next time...?'{}{}
5592:The eldercones turn back into their animal forms and pick up the goblin to carry him off. He turns to you:{}{}{}{}'You wouldn't win even if you tried 127 times!'{}{}{}{}They slowly move away. The bog bies smells your blood and circles ever closer.
5593:The goblin nods and whispers, as he is too weak to speak:{}{}{}{}'Just please take care. It is a nasty bog toxin that got into my blood...?I wouldn't want you to get hurt too.'
5594:Nod and say that you know your business. Attempt to heal him.
5595:The sprites do not speak. They look to the goblin, who answers you in a weak voice:{}{}{}{}'That bog bies - I kind of knew it was a stupid idea, but then I was like, hey, let's go for it...?fighting is rarely a good idea, right?'
5596:The goblin looks at you, astonished. He is still weak, but with the toxin out of his bloodstream, he seems much better:{}{}{}{}'Well, I'll be damned! Say, you seem really competent. Would you have me join your group?'
5597:Accept and welcome him.
5598:Politely decline but wish him well. 
5599:'Great! I hope you have plenty of food. I'm told I don't have enough variety in my diet.'
5600:Depart together.
5601:The toxin has spread too far. There is nothing you can do for him. The goblin looks at you and musters a smile:{}{}{}{}'Oh well, at least I won't die falling in a dragon cave.'{}{}{}{}The creatures huddle over their friend and prepare to carry him away. They nod at you in thanks for trying. 
5602:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. The goblin whispers at you as you run:{}{}{}{}'Fighting never seems to be the right answer, does it? Can't even beat a pair of dogs.'{}{}{}{}The goblin dies from his wounds, and his friends take his body away. 
5603:The ritual works and the bog bies is free of possession. Usually, this would mean it would disappear only to return again later, but with your divine power, you are able to possess it yourself and thus make it serve you.{}{}{}{}When you look back to the goblin and his menagerie, they are gone.
5604:Yes, possess the bog bies.
5605:No, allow it to disappear. 
5606:The beast clearly had pair of dogs at his side and one decides to stay. As the bog bies dies, its body slowly dissolves. As a demon of possession, it will likely have to endure this fate many times over. But it is gone for now.{}{}{}{}When you look back to the goblin and his menagerie, they are gone.
5607:Late at night you spot an old man wandering the land. He is tall, bearded, and - well, he does not seem to believe in clothing, apart from a rugged cloak on his shoulders.{}{}{}{}He does not come near you, or so you thought. Upon waking the next morning, you realise that one of your wise ones has been taken!{}{}{}{}Luckily for you, they left a spirit trail you can follow.
5608:Mark the trail on your map!
5609:The trail from your missing wise one leads to a tower. As you approach it, you feel the cold breeze of unliving presence all around you. 
5610:[Magic]This place is thick with the weaves of magic. Whoever resides here is very powerful. Tread carefully as you walk in.
5611:[Nyia]The smell of death is ripe. Whoever resides here defies the laws of your lady! Go in prepared for battle with the unliving.
5612:The tower is dark and filled to the brim with grimoires, scrolls, and artefacts. High up, under the ceiling, you see an iron contraption and your wise one attached to it, their blood slowly draining drop by drop into odd vials and tubes. {}{}{}{}Other blood is being pumped into them. The old naked man you saw before at night sits at a table, calmly reading a book.
5613:Demand to know who he is and why he took your friend.
5614:You defeat the man and are about to find a way up to help your friend when you hear laughter.{}{}{}{}The man rises, stretches his body, and puts his broken bones back into place:{}{}{}{}'You cannot defeat me, fools. But I have no quarrel with you, so you may leave me be.'
5615:You are defeated and the man laughs at you:{}{}{}{}'You cannot defeat me, fools. But I have no quarrel with you, so you may leave me be.'
5616:'Who am I, you ask? Hmm. Me and my kind go by many names. Wizards, some called us in days past. The Council of Six, we were too. Emissaries or prophets even by some, or rascals, necromancers, and meddlers by others.'
5617:[Zerca]This sounds like a man from the books of the Awakening. Is he a Kostej, or the Boneman who guards an oracle?
5618:Why did he kidnap your wise one and what is he doing to them?
5619:Since he says he is a mage, and he seems human, ask why there are typically no male magic users.
5620:'Oh, we really must learn new ways of introduction, it seems. No, I am Koshei, another one of the six. Somewhat less interested in the reservation of the mystical arts and more bothered about getting my own back to where they were. {}{}{}{}Your friend is feeding that goal, so you see, there is nothing you can do here.'
5621:Offer to find another way to feed his power - you are chosen, after all.
5622:Leave this place and look for clues as to how to kill this bastard.
5623:'I suppose that would be acceptable. Although my method is tried and tested, it is slow and I am impatient. {}{}{}{}Deal. Your friend will live for a good while yet, so come back with a better offer and I'll let them go.'
5624:Leave to search for ways to get him more power.
5625:When you were walking here, you spotted a witch's hut not too far away. With Koshei being so strong in magic, the witch is bound to know something and less likely to be immortal.
5626:Go track the witch.
5627:'For power and eternal life, of course. {}{}{}{}Your friend is feeding that goal, so you see, there is nothing you can do here.'
5628:'I do not care to teach you these things, but the story goes that the old god Veles gifted magic to a girl who tricked him. She was Viedma, mother of all witches. Soon it transpired that short-lived folk like humans and orcs could not handle magic very well, and corruption and darkness followed. {}{}{}{}The other gods swore never to gift magic to the short-lived folk.'
5629:And yet he is a man?
5630:'That I am, yes. The six of us were given the arts, but we were not to be the fathers of it. Thus our gifts could not be passed on.{}{}{}{}Nature, of course, does not abide by rules, nor does turmoil or darkness. Thus, boys are sometimes born with the talent, but as a rule, they are never trained in the arts lest the gods get angry.{}{}{}{}Now, enough history, and more about me!'{}{}
5631:There is a divine grove near here. Go there to ask the gods for inspiration.
5632:Leave to find the grove.
5633:You find the hut of the witch that resides near the Koshei. Its door is ajar and a voice beckons:{}{}{}{}'Come in, come in. I was expecting you.'
5634:Go in, but stay vigilant.
5635:A homely old lady sits by the fire, reading a book to a couple of kids. The children soon fall into a deep slumber, and she turns to you:{}{}{}{}'So you want old Viedma to tell you about that rascal up in the tower, eh?'
5636:Viedma, as in the fabled first witch?
5637:Ask how to kill Koshei.
5638:Ask if there is another way to give Koshei what he needs.
5639:Capture the witch. Koshei said he needs magic users, and this one surely will do.
5640:'Ha ha, I wish. No, but it is a name we use, those who follow her path.'
5641:'What's in it for me, eh? Pay up, and I will reveal his secrets to you.'
5642:Come back again later.
5643:'You see, those six men defied god's laws, so all their lives they've been obsessed with immortality, for they were terrified to stand before Veles, a master of both the underworlds and magic. {}{}{}{}Even though he is gone now, they are not stupid. They fear Nyia even more, for she lacks her father's mercy.'
5644:'And so, the fools came up with a gimmick. Each hid their life in an egg, the egg resides inside a duck, and the duck is stuffed into a rabbit- do not ask me how. The poor creature is then locked in a chest of diamond - fancy bastards, they were - and iron, to keep away some supernatural fiends. Then each chest was buried under a tree, each on its own island, and each man buried the other's chest, so even they do not know where it is.'
5645:But she does?
5646:'Oh, yes, I dated every one of those pompous sods, apart from Kostej - his high horse is unpalatable. {}{}{}{}Poor Koshei doesn't even know this is the very island where his chest lies. Here, I marked it on your map. The man dumped me for some young thing he kidnapped. I mean, I always knew his bad habits, but that last one just annoyed me. Go, kill his arse.'
5647:Attack her to get your stuff back and maybe even save those children!
5648:'Well, the obvious one, right? Give him another magic user to drain. And before you get any ideas, consider why I am here, living peacefully as his neighbor.'
5649:Is she powerful enough to stop him?
5650:'Ha ha, oh dearies, yes and no. I shagged him a lot. He is a twat, but he will not hurt me.{}{}{}{}So I guess I can give you a map to find an annoying bitch I always wanted dead. She may trust a god's chosen long enough for you to take her.'
5651:Yes, ask for the directions.
5652:Ask how to kill Koshei instead.
5653:Ignore her words and capture her.
5654:'Good. So, to business then.'
5655:Yes, ask her how to kill Koshei.
5656:Say that you would like the shortest version of how to kill the man. [Skip Story]
5657:You take your weapons out, and you immediately feel dizzy. Soon you find yourself standing outside, with no house to be seen. You find a note:{}{}{}{}'You waited too long, my dearies. I know better than to stick around once my services are rendered. Good luck killing the toad.'
5658:'He hid his life in an egg, the egg resides inside a duck, and the duck is stuffed into a rabbit -do not ask me how. The poor creature is then locked in a chest of diamond - fancy bastard, he was - and iron, to keep away some supernatural fiends. Then all this was buried under a tree, and since I dated the fool, I know where the tree is.'{}{}
5659:You capture the witch but she swears at you:{}{}{}{}'Fools, do you think I would live here, by his sorry side, if I was in danger? He will not harm me, for we were once lovers, and he is old-fashioned like that. This is why I stay here. Let me go now, and you may yet have a chance to save your friend...'
5660:No, take her back to Koshei anyway!
5661:'Idiots. Well, I am not telling you how to kill him now, as you pissed me off more than he has. {}{}{}{}So I guess I can give you a map to find an annoying bitch I always wanted dead. She may trust a god's chosen long enough for you to take her.'
5662:[Attractive male]Apologise for the rude behaviour, and compliment her youthful complexion and obvious vitality. Ask to spend some time with her one on one to show how sorry you are...
5663:'Well, I say we all make mistakes, and I am rather hungry for a nice piece of man flesh in me. Let's go.'{}{}{}{}She grabs you by the collar and leads you into her room. It smells of herbs, old scrolls, and dried blood. You are surprised how skilled she is for a lady her age.
5664:Ask if now she will tell you how to kill him, because you'd like to do it for her as much as for yourself.
5665:Thank her for the good time and ask for the directions to kill that other witch.
5666:You lost and the witch is furious. She calls out Koshei's name, and the man comes to her. He speaks to you:{}{}{}{}'Well, now, you have angered my woman...'{}{}{}{}'Your woman?!'{}{}{}{}'Ehem...?right. My friend. Thus, yours will die now. And do not bother looking for me, as I am sick of this land.'{}{}{}{}You are thrown outside. The hut and the tower that was seen from here both disappear before your eyes.
5667:You take only a few steps when Koshei appears:{}{}{}{}'Well, now, you have angered my woman...'{}{}{}{}'Your woman?!'{}{}{}{}'Ehem...right. My friend. Thus, yours will die now. And do not bother looking for me, as I am sick of this land.'{}{}{}{}You are thrown outside. The hut and the tower that was seen from here both disappear before your eyes.
5668:You find the divine oak where you can place your offerings to the gods and try to commune with your divine shepherd to ask for their aid in defeating this Koshei.{}{}{}{}As soon as you ask your question, you hear the voice of the gods issue through the tree. It is a confusing and terrifying cacophony of sounds.
5669:Politely ask the voice to simply command you what to do. [Skip Story]
5670:Say that you shall return, better prepared for this task.
5671:'That creature defiled both magic and nature to sustain its filthy existence. {}{}{}{}Long ago there were six of them, brothers. In time, some respected the natural way and perished, and others found a calling acceptable for redemption. {}{}{}{}The one you speak of did neither. He still thinks he can defy the gods!'
5672:Ask for guidance on how to kill him.
5673:'They have hidden their life from our sight long, long ago. Then the darkness came and we were weakened, dying. {}{}{}{}The Shattering once again threatens the strength of the divine, but now we have you, the chosen.'
5674:Ask how exactly he angered the gods so.
5675:'The creature made an error when he took one of you. Through them, we can finally claim his wretched soul.{}{}{}{}Now, you will perform a ritual that will likely hurt your spirit, but you will pay this price. Once you succeed, you can go back and kill him, and savour the look on his old face when you do, chosen ones.'
5676:Begin the ritual as instructed.
5677:There is a worrying pause that chills you to the bone, but then the voices speak:{}{}{}{}'The creature made an error when he took one of you. Through them, we can finally claim his wretched soul.{}{}{}{}Now, you will perform a ritual that will likely hurt your spirit, but you will pay this price. Once you succeed, you can go back and kill him, and savour the look on his old face when you do, chosen ones.'
5678:The ritual is successful and you feel the energy from the tree shower over you. At the back of your head, you can now feel the very entrance to the underworlds lying in wait for its prey. It is unsettling, to say the least.
5679:Thank the gods and go look for the tower again, since you know it moves. 
5680:'The existence of the six men who wielded magic against the divine rule was ever a sore subject. But when they were six, they were mostly honourable and did noble work. Thus, they were accepted. {}{}{}{}The one you found was ever the rebel. Basking in his own power, seeking to break our rules forever more. And hiding, scheming. He must pay.'
5681:You failed and you feel the displeasure of the gods land heavily on you. Worse yet, when you look for the tower again, Koshei is gone, and the depleted body of your friend has been left for you to find.
5682:You find the place where the viedma sent you to capture another victim for the Koshei and exchange her for your friend. {}{}{}{}You see this is a healer's hut. A family of four is just leaving, thanking an older woman for all the good she did. The woman looks at you:{}{}{}{}'Have you come for my help? Be warned, I am warded against fiends of evil here.'
5683:Reassure her that you are in fact the chosen of the gods, and as such you can be trusted.
5684:'Yes, yes, of course, I can sense your mark. I am sorry. I work hard to stay clear of the dark path of magic. Many do not like it and keep trying to take a swing at me.'{}{}{}{}Out of the corner of your eye, you notice someone watching you from inside her hut. She likely has bodyguards here.
5685:Now that her guard is down, attack and capture the witch!
5686:Tell her honestly of your predicament. Perhaps she knows a way out of it.
5687:'I am so sorry about your friend. Koshei is a blemish on the community. Alas, I do not know of a way to defeat him.{}{}{}{}I have sworn myself to helping others, and you are the chosen. I will sacrifice my life for that of your friend so that the gods may proceed with their work.'
5688:Accept her sacrifice and take her back to Koshei. 
5689:Say that you feel bad now, and you will not do it.
5690:'I am so sorry about your friend. Koshei is a blemish on the community. Alas, I do not know of a way to defeat him.{}{}{}{}Best I can do is offer some of my knowledge, train one of you as best I can. But I am afraid you must say farewell to your friend.'
5691:Accept this.
5692:Attack her!
5693:'It is good that you choose the path of peace. Now choose the training you would like me to give.'
5694:Train a girl to become a young witch.
5695:Train a zerca to heal. 
5696:Train a gatherer to heal.
5697:Train a crafter to heal.
5698:Train a female gatherer to become a young witch.
5699:Train a child to heal.
5700:There are none the witch deems particularly worthy, so she offers to teach a random person to heal.
5701:'How dare you come here and burden me with your woes. You are the chosen, and you are supposed to deal with such things for us common folk! I am very sad to hear of your friend's fate, but I do not know how to aid you. You'd best leave.'
5702:Leave, even if it means abandoning your kidnapped friend for good.
5703:You must save your friend. Attack!
5704:When you look for the tower again, Koshei is gone, and the depleted body of your friend has been left for you to find.
5705:You capture the witch and kill her bodyguards. She cries out in pain for her loss.
5706:Take her to Koshei.
5707:Ask about her odd choice of bodyguards.
5708:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. When you look for the tower again, Koshei is gone, and the depleted body of your friend has been left for you to find.
5709:'Why, do you suppose all creatures of the night are evil? I cured his bloodlust and he protected me. He was my...you beast!'{}{}{}{}She turns away from you and does not speak anymore, only cries.
5710:You find the tree under which Koshei's diamond chest should be buried. 
5711:Dig it out.
5712:You dig the chest out, but there doesn't seem to be a way to open it.
5713:Use brute force.
5714:[Magic user]Use magic.
5715:[Intelligence]Try to figure out a way.
5716:Take it back to Koshei to negotiate for your friend's life.
5717:You break the chest open, and inside you find a dried-up rabbit with an unnaturally bloated stomach. You delve deeper and uncover the duck and finally the egg. You break the egg and a hiss of energy is released. {}{}{}{}The tower appears nearby and you hear a scream of agony:{}{}{}{}'Noooo! How?'
5718:Go get your friend.
5719:You see the dried-up remains of Koshei, his face twisted in fear. You sense the presence of the goddess Nyia as she claims this wayward soul for a long-awaited punishment.{}{}{}{}Your friend is weakened, but alive. The tower, alas, is just as dried up as its owner.
5720:Take them and leave this place.
5721:You fail to open the chest. 
5722:You open the chest, and inside you find a dried-up rabbit with an unnaturally bloated stomach. You delve deeper and uncover the duck and finally the egg. You break the egg and a hiss of energy is released. {}{}{}{}The tower appears nearby and you hear a scream of agony:{}{}{}{}'Noooo! How?'
5723:You find Koshei's tower again, and as you approach, he comes out to meet you. He looks anxious. His skeletal minions hold your friend.{}{}{}{}'I see you have recovered something of mine. An easy swap, yes?'
5724:Yes, give him back the chest for your friend.
5725:He is obviously desperate for this. Ask for a reward on top of it.
5726:'Good, good. Now go.'
5727:'Fine, have a reward too. Now go.'{}{}{}{}He hands over your friend and a bundle of goods. Then he runs back into the tower, clutching the chest.
5728:You find Koshei's tower again, and as you approach, he comes out, poised for an attack:{}{}{}{}'You think you can come and blackmail ME? You will die and I will take the chest off your corpse!'{}{}
5729:Tell him you were not going to blackmail him. You are simply nice enough to return the chest to him unopened. All you ask is your friend back, a favour for a favour. 
5730:You defeat Koshei, but you are at the same standstill. {}{}{}{}He rises, but this time he is not laughing. He looks you up and down:{}{}{}{}'A worthy opponent, yes. I cannot seem to defeat you, and you cannot kill me. You could go away and try to open the chest, but then your kin would be dead. I yield. Hand over the chest, and I shall free your friend and throw in a gift.'
5731:'No!'{}{}{}{}He attacks.
5732:You are defeated and Koshei takes the chest off you:{}{}{}{}'I should kill you all now, but I suppose you did me a favour by finding the egg. {}{}{}{}Begone, and do not return for I will no longer be here. Your friend is lost, but you live on.'{}{}{}{}He throws you out of the tower and you watch it disappear.
5733:You exchange the chest for your friend and Koshei walks into his tower, then the whole thing disappears.
5734:'You arrogant whelp! I shall take the chest off your corpse!'{}{}{}{}He attacks.
5735:You return to the tower and approach Koshei. He turns to you with a smug smile:{}{}{}{}'What, come to beg, or play fight again?'
5736:Attack him!
5737:Tell him of your power and suggest that he gives back your friend if he wishes to live.
5738:You defeat Koshei and, just as before, he rises and tries to reset his bones. But to his utter terror, his body remains mangled and slowly begins to rot away, while he yet lives:{}{}{}{}'Noooo! What have you done! How?'{}{}{}{}You see a crack in the floor open, and ghostly hands drag Koshei straight into the underworld.
5739:Get your friend.
5740:Your friend is alive and you feel the gods are pleased with your deed. {}{}{}{}The tower, alas, rots away like its former master, so you are forced to leave quickly.
5741:He watches you intensely and takes a few steps back. You see fear in his eyes for the first time:{}{}{}{}'You...how? This should not be possible, we calculated...yes, yes, I agree to your terms. Here, I'll throw in a gift for the one who bested me. This has never happened to me before...'{}{}
5742:Take your friend back and leave the tower as agreed. 
5743:You are defeated, and Koshei laughs at you and your gods:{}{}{}{}'I should kill you all now, but I suppose you amused me. {}{}{}{}Begone, and do not return for I will no longer be here. Your friend is lost, but you live on.'{}{}{}{}He throws you out of the tower and you watch it disappear.
5744:He watches you intensely and takes a few steps back. You see fear in his eyes for the first time. But before you are able to speak again, you feel the wrath of the gods fall upon you both.{}{}{}{}Koshei is dragged back into the underworld along with his entire tower and your friend, and you feel the gods are disappointed in your attempts to shirk your duty.
5745:You find the tower again and Koshei welcomes you:{}{}{}{}'Ah, so you caught me a witch, did you? Oh, and she does smell of power, how splendid.'
5746:Hand the witch over.
5747:Negotiate for a better reward.
5748:'Fine, have a reward too. Now go.'{}{}{}{}He hands over your friend and a bundle of goods, then returns to his work, waving you away.
5749:You defeat Koshei, but you are at the same standstill. He rises, but this time he is not laughing. He looks you up and down:{}{}{}{}'A worthy opponent, yes. I cannot seem to defeat you, and you cannot kill me. How amusing. I shall free your friend and throw in a gift. But pray, do not cross my path again, for I may not be in such a good mood next time.'
5750:You are defeated and Koshei laughs at you:{}{}{}{}'Begone, and do not return for I will no longer be here. Your friend is lost, but you live on.'{}{}{}{}He throws you out of the tower and you watch it disappear.
5751:You exchange the witch for your friend. Koshei walks into his tower, then the whole thing disappears.
5752:'You arrogant whelp!'{}{}{}{}He attacks.
5753:You come across some slavers. They stop and show you their wares:{}{}{}{}'We ain't got much right now, but you're welcome to look.?
5754:Look.
5755:Most of their stock are farm animals, but you do see a fairly healthy goat.{}{}{}{}There are also some children, but they look very ill - barely alive, in fact. There is one human, one goblin, and one orc youngster here.{}{}{}{}You also see a woman who is gagged, with a price tag of 25 mithril or better metal.
5756:Ask about the woman.
5757:Buy the goat.
5758:Buy the human child.
5759:Buy the goblin child.
5760:Buy the orc child.
5761:'Oh, her - special find. We're selling her on behalf of a client, hence the specific price. {}{}{}{}Truth be told, she was once his prized crafter. ?Hands of gold,? he called her. Promised him the lead on some old treasure, a divine goblet or some other rubbish.{}{}{}{}But as with such time wasters, she became more trouble than she was worth, so he told us to sell her.'
5762:Buy her.
5763:Go back to the other wares.
5764:The woman bows before you as a servant would:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, oh, thank you so much! I can lead you to the holy trinket, that I can, yes.'
5765:Tell her she does not need to do anything. She is free to stay with you or go.
5766:Say that she'd better, as you paid a lot for her.
5767:She looks at you rather shocked, then smiles. Her face changes from a simpleton to a confident woman as she answers:{}{}{}{}'I have waited long for those words. I did not think folk had it in them anymore. I thank you, and the gods will bless your kindness. Farewell.'
5768:Wish her well and leave.
5769:You kill the slavers but find that they destroyed most of their 'stock' rather than let you have it.
5770:Search for any survivors and leave.
5771:You rescue a woman. She bows before you as a servant would:{}{}{}{}'Thank you, oh, thank you so much! I can lead you to the holy trinket, that I can, yes.'
5772:Say that she'd better, as you risked your own life to rescue her.
5773:You are badly beaten and forced to flee, and they may have taken someone into slavery!
5774:The directions from Yukislava lead you to a large hallowed tree. She told you the holy trinket is inside.
5775:Ask her what this trinket is supposed to be, anyway.
5776:Nod and check the tree.
5777:'Oh, well, people say it is the very artefact that the all-father Perun held in his arm before he disappeared from our lands.'
5778:And how did she come to know of this?
5779:'Well, you see, I am the direct descending daughter of the servant to Briamir, and he of course was the second general who died less heroically but in that same moment that Mokosh took the spirit of Perun into her arms and made him divine.'
5780:You reach into the hallowed tree and are grabbed by something!
5781:You kill the eldercones, and Yukislava looks really sad but does not say anything. Inside the tree is indeed a buried artefact, but it is hardly worth being called divine.
5782:Take it and leave.
5783:Ask Yukislava why she did not fight with you or tell you about the eldercones.
5784:'I only ever said I knew where the divine trinket was buried, masters. Never said it was unguarded. But you fought well, so I will stay and serve for good now.'{}{}{}{}You see a change in her demeanour. She looks more relaxed around you now and stops behaving like a dumb servant.
5785:Take the trinket and leave.
5786:The eldercones beat you badly and yell, 'You cannot have the divine grail!'{}{}{}{}They take Yukislava away with them and curse the lot of you. The girl waves at you:{}{}{}{}'Always look at the bright side of life, unless it is about to burn you. Farewell!'
5787:The directions from Yukislava lead you to a large oak tree. She told you the holy trinket is hidden within it.
5788:The tree rises, opens its eyes, and stares at you in bewilderment:{}{}{}{}'What?'
5789:Tell it that you search for a divine artefact and were told it is hidden here.
5790:'Bah, the divine trinket is a silly story told by silly demons who never learn their place.'{}{}{}{}He snaps a twig at Yukislava, and she is turned into an eldercone. {}{}{}{}'That's better. Now, silly one, go back with these folk, learn to be good, and leave me be.'
5791:[Forest demon]Ask the leshy why he speaks so normally.
5792:Thank him and leave with your changed companion.
5793:'I took diction classes from a goblin. They are fast little things. Now, I may speak quickly, but I am still in need of my tree sleep. Begone, little ones.'
5794:'Bah, the divine trinket is a silly story told by silly demons who never learn their place.'{}{}{}{}He snaps a twig at Yukislava, and she is turned into an eldercone and taken by the tree. The leshy snaps at you:{}{}{}{}'And you, begone from my sight. I have nooo patience fooor you!'
5795:You kill the leshy and find that one of his branches was a strong wand.
5796:Ask Yukislava if it is the divine treasure she spoke of.
5797:Take the wand and leave.
5798:The woman looks shocked that you defeated the leshy, but when you speak to her, she resumes her 'loyal servant' routine:{}{}{}{}'Oh, yes, yes, must be, masters, must be. Now, let us go and face more adventures. The gods are surely happy now.'
5799:You come to a tree, but there is nothing here, although you feel you may see something if you take Yukislava here with you.
5800:'Thank you! Here is a family heirloom I hid away, for you.'
5801:Thank her and leave together.
5802:You find a stash of goods under a tree, but when you reach for it, you discover it was rigged with odd green powder that explodes in your faces and makes you ill.{}{}{}{}Yukislava, now turned into her true form as an unliving, looks at you, scared:{}{}{}{}'Please don't kill me or sell me on. If you kill me, you will be cursed, and if you sell me on, this will just continue, and I do not want more trouble for people. Just never ask me to take you to the treasure again, and let me stay. Please?'
5803:Agree to her terms and let her stay with you.
5804:Tell her to leave.
5805:The leshy defeats you and shouts: 'You cannot have one of mine!'{}{}{}{}He takes Yukislava away and curses the lot of you. The girl waves at you:{}{}{}{}'Always look at the bright side of life, unless it is about to burn you. Farewell!'
5806:You come across a small hamlet of houses. You hear terrible cries from one of them, and you see a child sitting outside, covering their ears.
5807:Approach the child and ask what is going on.
5808:'Oh, sorry. It's Uncle Tobiasz again. He's our hunter, but he is really weird. He lost his bunny again and he just cries and shouts all day. They told me to watch him, but I am real sick of it. Can you tell him to stop, or leave? We've all had enough. He attacked my da because he thought the stupid bunny was at our place.'
5809:Tell him you will speak to the man.
5810:Agree to help find the bunny so the man calms down. 
5811:You walk into the house and see a man clutching a bunch of white fur. His eyes are bloodshot and swollen, his hair unruly, and he is pacing up and down the room. He spots you and grabs you by your clothes:{}{}{}{}'You, have you seen him? Have you seen BUNNY? Or did you kill him? Oh no, no, no don't say that, nooo...'{}{}{}{}The boy looks at you and throws up his arms.
5812:Tell the man to calm the hells down. He is scaring the child. 
5813:Say that you will help him find his bunny if he promises to stop behaving like this.
5814:This is none of your business. Leave.
5815:Kill him.
5816:'Calm down? I can't CALM DOWN!'
5817:You take one good swing at the crazy bunny man and he falls on the floor, dead and finally quiet.{}{}{}{}The child stares at you, then speaks:{}{}{}{}'Awesome!'
5818:Ask the child to come with you.
5819:'All right, why not? My pa always says I need to go be my own person.'
5820:'You will? Oh my, thank you! He is small, like this, and he is white and fluffy and he likes carrots, and when he got lost all I found was this odd drawing of a tree.'{}{}{}{}The man is in no state to accompany you.
5821:Oddly, you recognise this tree. You passed it on your way here. Mark it on your map and leave.
5822:You follow the trail of the lost bunny and find a pack of wolves circling an area. Their howling sounds desperate, not aggressive.{}{}{}{}Almost every wolf in the pack is injured in some way. One has a broken paw, one a swollen nose, another a bitten ear, and one looks like it was chewed and spat out.
5823:[Animal kinship]Ask the wolves what happened.
5824:[Hunter]Observe the wolves further.
5825:Kill the wolves.
5826:You see the alpha run out from behind a tree, shouting:{}{}{}{}'Nu pagadi!' He has a branch stuck in his eyes. He turns to you and speaks:{}{}{}{}'Oww, it is bad, sooo bad. All we wanted was some good rabbit meat, juicy, succulent...but that damned thing, it is as if fate itself protects it! Please, please take it away!'
5827:Look for the bunny.
5828:The wolves point you to a small clearing where a white bunny is grazing. All around it you see oddities, broken traps, and pieces of wolf fur. There is a dead wolf under a stone that must have fallen from the sky.{}{}{}{}The bunny occasionally stops grazing and starts dancing and humming a tune. Then it stops and eats again.
5829:Go get the bunny.
5830:[Intelligence]Figure out a way to get the bunny safely, as there is clearly something odd happening here.
5831:It takes you a long time to try to catch the little bugger.{}{}{}{}You finally approach the bunny and try to grab it. At the last second, the creature is spooked by a sudden bird cry, and a dead stork dives right into you.
5832:Abandon this task. Leave!
5833:It takes you a long time to try to catch the little bugger.{}{}{}{}You finally approach the bunny and try to grab it. At the last second, you step into a hole you could swear was not there before. The hole is filled with obnoxious, filthy sludge - perhaps excrement? It makes you ill.
5834:It takes you a long time to try to catch the little bugger.{}{}{}{}You finally approach the bunny and try to grab it. At the last second, it does its odd little dance so you miss, and you trip and land facedown on a rattlesnake that bites you in the eye before slithering away.
5835:It takes you a long time to try to catch the little bugger.{}{}{}{}You finally approach the bunny and try to grab it. At the last second, it begins its odd little dance, but you are ready for such twists and you nab it and put it into a basket.{}{}{}{}You hear grateful howls from afar.{}{}
5836:Go find the rabbit man.
5837:You figure out that an odd turn of fate creates a distraction mere seconds before the creature is to be taken. Once you know the pattern, it is easier to work around it.{}{}{}{}You finally approach the bunny and try to grab it. At the last second, it begins its odd little dance, but you are ready for such twists and you nab it and put it into a basket.{}{}{}{}You hear grateful howls from afar.{}{}
5838:You have no idea what is going on here.
5839:Try to grab the bunny.
5840:You take a swing at the bunny, but you lose your footing at the last minute and hit yourself instead.{}{}{}{}Eventually, you do get the little bugger, but it was not an easy task.
5841:You kill most of the pack, but others escape and watch you from afar, as if waiting to see something. Then you see a small clearing where a white bunny is grazing. All around it you see oddities, broken traps, and pieces of wolf fur. There is a dead wolf under a stone that must have fallen from the sky.{}{}{}{}The bunny occasionally stops grazing and starts dancing and humming a tune. Then it stops and eats again.
5842:Abandon this task and leave.
5843:The wolves beat you, but they look too worn out to chase after you. {}{}{}{}In fact, one of them points you in the direction of the bunny you came to find.
5844:Look where they pointed.
5845:You see a small clearing where a white bunny is grazing. All around it you see oddities, broken traps, and pieces of wolf fur. There is a dead wolf under a stone that must have fallen from the sky.{}{}{}{}The bunny occasionally stops grazing and starts dancing and humming a tune. Then it stops and eats again.
5846:You follow the trail of the lost bunny and come across a large mansion where an old man greets you.{}{}{}{}He sits by a lake in his garden, surrounded by several rusalka who serve him. All of the women have rabbit ears crudely sewn onto their foreheads and rabbit tails attached to their bottoms.{}{}
5847:[Water demon]Speak to your sisters in the tongue of water and ask why they serve this sick old man so. He is not even a vodnik.
5848:Speak to the man. Ask about the lost bunny.
5849:They turn to you and whisper:{}{}{}{}'We are freed from the rules of water, but as you well know, our nature commands that we follow another. This master is odd, true, but it is fun here, and we like it.'
5850:Ask about the dead animal parts sewn onto them.
5851:'Oh, yes. An oddity the old man likes.'{}{}{}{}The way they speak to you seems off, and you suspect those rabbit parts are enchanted.
5852:Try to break the enchantment by facing your kin in spiritual battle. 
5853:They will likely defend the old man, but they must be freed. Attack!
5854:You kill the man and some of his 'bunnies'. Those who live look shocked and lost. They quickly dive into the lake.{}{}{}{}Alas, you do not find any living bunnies.
5855:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. If you try to return, the house is gone.
5856:'I am afraid the only bunnies hopping around are my lovelies. Here, have a drink on me.{}{}{}{}But I can sell you this little white goat - it kind of looks like a bunny. I almost thought it was at first, hence it being here with me.'
5857:Buy the fake bunny to try to trick the bunny man.
5858:[Attractive]Ask for the fake bunny for free.
5859:No, abandon this task and leave.
5860:'Why, I never could say no to a pretty face. Here, take it and have fun.'
5861:'Please vacate my premises. You are spoiling my view of the bunnies.'
5862:You free the rusalka and they immediately attack the old man, ripping him into shreds and drowning his bloody carcass in the lake. {}{}{}{}One turns to you:{}{}{}{}'Thank you. We do not have any live bunnies for you, but here, take this goat - it looks a bit like a bunny. Maybe your man will take it.'
5863:You fail to defeat the rusalka and are forced to run. If you try to return, the house is gone.
5864:The bunny man, Tobiasz, finds you on your way back:{}{}{}{}'You found him! Thank you, thank you so much. I shall come with you and be at your service from now on. Oh, and Radzio gave me this gift for you, said to tell you thanks and good luck. Whatever does he mean, odd child...?'
5865:Actually, admit that you do not have the bunny.
5866:'What, but...why? Bring him to me, then I will come with you.'
5867:The bunny man, Tobiasz, finds you on your way back. He is accompanied by a friend:{}{}{}{}'You found him?'{}{}{}{}He looks at you suspiciously. 
5868:Take out the white baby goat and convince him it is in fact his bunny, changed by magic.
5869:Actually, admit that you do not have the bunny (or the goat bunny with you).
5870:'Oh, well, fair enough. We are reunited, Nala!{}{}{}{}'Now, I shall join you. Oh, and Radzio gave me this gift for you, said to tell you thanks and good luck. Whatever does he mean, odd child...?'
5871:'No, no, you evil people...'{}{}{}{}He runs off distraught.{}{}
5872:You find the place where you should look for the lost bunny, but you find a group of armour-clad warriors standing outside a cave, arguing.{}{}{}{}'You go in now.'{}{}'No, you.'{}{}'We should just leave.'{}{}'It is our duty to -'{}{}'Oh, just shut up with the duty.'
5873:Approach and ask what is going on and whether they've seen the bunny.
5874:The armed fighters turn to you, weapons at the ready but not drawn:{}{}{}{}'The bunny? You must be kidding, right? We've been trying to kill the little sod for days. It guards the entrance to a treasure we seek.'
5875:A bunny?
5876:Tell them to move aside and send one person to retrieve the animal.
5877:'Let us not do the whole "a bunny, you must be kidding" - the thing is obviously enchanted or something. Unfortunately, one of its first victims was our wise one, so we're stuck. Say, if you help us get rid of it, we'll share the treasure, eh?'
5878:[Magic user]Take a closer look at the animal.
5879:Agree to help. Do they have a plan?
5880:'The way we see it, we have two choices. Our zerca was a follower of Svarog, and he made this sun artefact that is said to cleanse any darkness from any creature. But it needs a very specific activation, and, well, we do not know what it is on account of the man dying before he told us. If you do it wrong, the sun will burn us all.'
5881:And the second choice?
5882:'The second would be us all working together. You go distract the little bugger, maybe even catch it for its owner if you wish, and we sneak in to get the treasure. {}{}{}{}Apparently, once the treasure is taken, any magic will collapse, so perhaps your rabbit will become normal again.'
5883:Try the direct path and distract the bunny.
5884:Attempt to use the sun artefact.
5885:'Are you sure? It did not end well for us.'{}{}{}{}They stand aside, but you see the corpses of men and a small white bunny grazing on them.
5886:Yes, go.
5887:No, bad idea.
5888:The bunny tears into you as if you were a puppet, its beady black eyes glistening with joy as your blood splatters its snowy fur.
5889:Attack together!
5890:The bunny bites and tears at your flesh. It is too small and too fast - your numbers help you to stay alive but not to kill it.
5891:Retreat and consider other options.
5892:This bunny is possessed by a particularly nasty bies. Perhaps even more than one. They are all bound to an object inside the cave.{}{}{}{}You can try to take the bies out of the bunny, then attack the creatures as it will no longer be as deadly.{}{}{}{}Or you can attempt a ritual to banish the bies, but it will be tough.
5893:Expose the bies and fight with them!
5894:Drag the bies out and face them in a spiritual fight.
5895:Try other options.
5896:The bies are defeated and the bunny is its normal self again. The warriors look at you with respect:{}{}{}{}'Now that is what we call professional. Here, your share of the treasure, rightfully earned. May the sun god keep you safe.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
5897:Attack them and take all the treasure!
5898:Wish them well also and leave.
5899:You defeat the warriors and claim their part of the treasure, but it turns out the only thing they took from the chest was a ring, one of little value as far as you can tell.
5900:The warriors defeat you but leave you alive and do not even take back the treasure they gave you. They simply leave in silence.
5901:You are defeated and the white bunny dies in the fight too. {}{}{}{}The other warriors eventually kill the bies. One of them comes over:{}{}{}{}'You fought well and gave us the opportunity to take what we came here for. Here is a small reward. I am sorry your animal died.'{}{}{}{}They depart.
5902:Your ritual banishes the bies from this place and the bunny is its normal self again. The warriors look at you with respect:{}{}{}{}'Now that is what we call professional. Here, your share of the treasure, rightfully earned. May the sun god keep you safe.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
5903:Your ritual fails and the white bunny attacks you. The warriors use you as bait and manage to kill it.{}{}{}{}The other warriors eventually kill the bies. One of them comes over:{}{}{}{}'You fought well and gave us the opportunity to take what we came here for. Here is a small reward. I am sorry your animal died.'{}{}{}{}They depart.
5904:They present you with a circular object, handcrafted in mithril and pristine matter. {}{}{}{}You need to whisper the right number so that it works properly.
5905:[Light]You do not know the number, but you call upon your domain to obey your command!
5906:[Zerca]The number shall be three, of course - certainly not four, absolutely not five, and one would never say two, no. Three.
5907:Nine, like the number of the gods.
5908:Three seems like a good number.
5909:Ten is often used as a countdown.
5910:You whisper the number and throw the ball. In three heartbeats it opens up and a blinding, divine light washes over you all. The bunny is cleansed and you feel replenished too. {}{}{}{}'Now that is what we call professional. Here, your share of the treasure, rightfully earned. May the sun god keep you safe.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
5911:You call out to your domain and throw the ball. In three heartbeats it opens up and a blinding, divine light washes over you all. The bunny is cleansed and you feel replenished too. {}{}{}{}'Now that is what we call professional. Here, your share of the treasure, rightfully earned. May the sun god keep you safe.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
5912:The orb explodes and kills the bunny and the warriors and almost kills you. Your divine connection is likely the only reason you are alive. There is no treasure to be found, only ashes.
5913:You manage to fool the bunny long enough for the warriors to break the spell. The bunny is its normal self again. The warriors look at you with respect:{}{}{}{}'Now that is what we call professional. Here, your share of the treasure, rightfully earned. May the sun god keep you safe.'{}{}{}{}They move out.
5914:You did a good job as bait, but not without some severe wounds. To save your life, the warriors had to kill the rabbit, and they lost more men:{}{}{}{}'You fought well and gave us the opportunity to take what we came here for. Here is a small reward. I am sorry your animal died.'{}{}{}{}They depart.{}{}113{}{}
5915:You come to a settlement claimed by the light. Its folk roam the streets in unison, working, crafting, ploughing the fields, all in silence, all together. {}{}{}{}When they spot you, they approach:{}{}{}{}'You have come to join us?'
5916:No, tell them you have come to talk and perhaps establish a friendship.
5917:'You are either one of us, or you are not. Come . . .'{}{}{}{}Light wisps begin to circle you, their cold heat on your skin and burning icicles touching your guts in an attempt at joining.
5918:Refuse and leave quickly.
5919:[Turmoil or Light]This is an abomination that defies both turmoil (seeking to tame it) and light (abusing its power). Attack head on!
5920:[Magic or Nature]This force seems immaterial. Call upon your domain and face these fiends with your spirit!
5921:[Harmony or Intellect]Show them the strength of your mind, a will that will not be bent. 
5922:You destroy the lightbringers and the village burns, as if the light will not allow you a full victory. 
5923:You are badly beaten and forced to flee. One or more of your folk could fall under their dominion . . .
5924:Your resistance wakens something within the taken folk and they banish the light from their souls! Alas, their bodies are too weak and burnt out to survive without the hive mind and they fall dead, but free. {}{}{}{}The village itself burns as if the light would not abide your victory.
5925:'Bringer of light, come, see us. One day you will join. For now some us may wish to travel with you.'
5926:See the light village.
5927:The village seems frozen in time. The people move so slowly you can barely see it. Yet they all seem really happy. {}{}{}{}
5928:Have your spirit healed.
5929:Have your mental health cured.
5930:Remove curses. 
5931:Recruit lightbringers.
5932:Nothing to do for now, leave.
5933:A group of folk taken by the light scourge approaches you - lightbringers, as they are now known.{}{}{}{}They do not speak. They seek only to bring you into their commune with the light-mind.
5934:Speak to them.
5935:Face them with your spirit!
5936:You destroy the lightbringers and their bodies turn to ash. 
5937:Your spirit is too weak. The lightbringers assail you, and you barely escape - and perhaps some of you do not . . .
5938:'You, you gave more light. You will join when you are ready...'{}{}{}{}They move away.
5939:A group of the lightbringers approaches, but they suddenly simply collapse. The destruction of the light-beast is working.
5940:Woken by a distant tremor, you rise from the gravel and dust that surrounds you. Mere steps away from you, a deep gash has swallowed the farmhouse that gave you refuge the night before. Dust and debris are all that remains.
5941:Look for survivors.
5942:Run away. 
5943:You search the debris for other survivors. There was a family of six. The little girl gave you her doll to keep you safe at night...
5944:Keep looking!
5945:There are no signs of life. In fact, you realise that it is very quiet and still here, as if time itself has halted. You look down the chasm to check for bodies, but instead of the darkness you expected, you are blinded by a ray of bright light.
5946:Step back.
5947:The light dims and before you stands the family. Their bodies are twisted and broken from the Shattering, but they seem unhindered by it, their eyes white and focused, yet empty. Their limbs are loose - unnaturally relaxed, even. At first you assume they are now unliving, but you can see blood still pumping in their veins and their hearts beating slowly.{}{}{}{}They walk away from you without a word, moving together in unnerving unison.
5948:[Harmony or Light]Try to call out to them.
5949:[Turmoil or Magic]Observe their movements.
5950:[Nature or Intellect]Stay vigilant.
5951:There is a sense of overwhelming harmony, an exuberant blast of light and order that stifles your mind and soul. The gods favour balance, and these people -or whatever got them - is destroying it. {}{}{}{}Your bodies freeze and you hear the light calling you, but your bond with the divine keeps you safe for now.
5952:In the name of light, direct action is needed! Attack them to purge this abominable force.
5953:In harmony we must trust, even now. Speak to the people: 'Rosa, Vieslav, do you not recognise me? What has happened to you?'
5954:It is not wise to meddle with the unknown. Follow them at a distance and observe.
5955:An oppressive emanation of light and order pushes against your very being. This light seeks to stifle any magic or darkness, and the order seeks to diminish all turmoil. Your bones twist and your blood boils from the assault!
5956:Battle these fiends with magic!
5957:Stay back and only observe.
5958:Whatever these people have become, they are overfilled with the energy of light and harmony. This stifling, unnatural concentration of force is an abomination against both nature and intellect.
5959:It stands against nature. Best be rid of it. Attack.
5960:Mystical forces seem to be at work here. Attack them spiritually.{}
5961:Weary from your travels, you come across a small hamlet, and you are invited to rest and eat with the family. {}{}{}{}They also offer their stables as a place to camp if you need to.
5962:Accept their hospitality.
5963:Decline and move on.
5964:You get a warm meal and are invited to listen to folk tales from the old baba. The children ask you many questions about the wider world, and you are somewhat relieved when it is time to sleep.
5965:Rest.
5966:You walk away and set up camp, but you are rudely awakened by a strong tremor. You are hit by some stray rocks and walk about disoriented for a time until you come across a deep gash that has swallowed the farmhouse that offered you refuge the night before. Dust and debris are all that remain.
5967:You defeat the family and see their bodies burn to ash as they fall. {}{}{}{}The oppressive light lingers, as if searching for a new host, but it does not approach you, and eventually it disappears.
5968:You are defeated and your spirit is assaulted. Your divine bond protects you, and eventually the enemy moves away, blindly following some unheard call.
5969:You try to talk, but they do not engage. Do they even hear you? You are unsure. Instead, they try to embrace you, and their light attempts to engulf you.{}{}{}{}You feel encouraged by your steadfast resolve for peace, but clearly, they do not share your belief. Your divine bond protects you, and eventually the enemy moves away, blindly following some unheard call.
5970:They continue to walk, occasionally trying to turn to you and reach out with the oppressive light.{}{}{}{}Your divine bond protects you, and eventually the enemy moves away, blindly following some unheard call.{}{}
5971:You wake to find some of your goods missing!
5972:[Perception or hunter] Track the thieves.
5973:Such is life. Leave.
5974:Track the thieves.
5975:With your skill in tracking, the previous night's rain has no impact. {}{}{}{}You know exactly where to look for the thieves, and you know they were likely human, judging by the size and depth of the tracks. 
5976:Mark their location on your map and move out.
5977:It must have rained in the night, for the tracks have faded. It will be a difficult task.{}{} 
5978:Track the scoundrels as quickly as possible.
5979:The tracks go cold and end up going around in circles, but eventually you think you find the right direction. 
5980:You come across a small settlement, or at least what typically passes as one for scavengers. It is shabby and dark, and smells of rotten flesh.{}{}
5981:Take a closer look, quietly.
5982:Charge in!
5983:You see people sitting around a badly made fire. There are a few kids - thin, feral-looking. Some grownups with visible ailments, such as skin growths, missing limbs, scabs, coughing up blood, and such. {}{}{}{}Some of the people have weapons - five, by your count.
5984:The settlement goes quiet and a small group approaches you with weapons drawn. A middle-aged, heavy-set woman rolls in from behind the armed group and speaks, her voice distorted by scabs covering her lips and face:{}{}{}{}'Who're you then? You come to stick us?'{}{}
5985:Say that you do not want to harm them, but you were asked by the red-ridge bandits to get rid of them, and for the sake of divine providence, you must do so.
5986:Nod and admit that is what you came here for. Prepare for a fight.
5987:Say that you came here to warn them that the bandits have new allies and are about to come and kill them all!
5988:'Those filthy buggers! Them lot who take our kin and kill us. Why you doing their dirty work, eh?'
5989:[Scavenger]Tell them it's each person for themselves, as it's always been. The bandits offered a deal and you need what they have -- simple.
5990:Say that you are on a path of the divine. The bandits have what you need, the red cave, so you need the scavengers to move out if they wish to avoid bloodshed.
5991:'Oh, you all high and mighty now, eh? I smell no mind-itching on you, no flesh-itching too? You all good-flesh now, are you? How?'
5992:Say that you follow the gods, so your flesh is healed. Tell them you need to get to a place called the red cave to do a job for the gods. Ask them to help you, and maybe one day their flesh will be healed too.
5993:'We do not go nowhere! This is our patch, and if you don't go, we stick you like pigs!'
5994:Show them your mark of the chosen, and try to convince them that the gods will be angry if they do not obey.
5995:Just attack!
5996:You speak with divine gravity and they cower before you:{}{}{}{}'Okay, okay, please don't make the gods angry at us! This place is shit anyways, we go now.But those bandits, they be bad. Maybe you consider helpin' us instead?'
5997:No. Wait for them to leave and report your success to the bandits.
5998:Agree to listen.
5999:'You shut your yaps and go shit yourselves now. Go, else we stick ya like pigs!'
6000:'So they took you in and you one of them now. Well, nice for you, right? So you will help your own, then?'{}{}
